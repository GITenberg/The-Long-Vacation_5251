    <h2>
      PREFACE
    </h2>
    <p>
      If a book by an author who must call herself a veteran should be taken up
      by readers of a younger generation, they are begged to consider the first
      few chapters as a sort of prologue, introduced for the sake of those of
      elder years, who were kind enough to be interested in the domestic
      politics of the Mohuns and the Underwoods.
    </p>
    <p>
      Continuations are proverbially failures, and yet it is perhaps a
      consequence of the writer&rsquo;s realization of characters that some seem as if
      they could not be parted with, and must be carried on in the mind, and not
      only have their after-fates described, but their minds and opinions under
      the modifications of advancing years and altered circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turner and other artists have been known literally to see colours in
      absolutely different hues as they grew older, and so no doubt it is with
      thinkers. The outlines may be the same, the tints are insensibly modified
      and altered, and the effect thus far changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus it is with the writers of fiction. The young write in full sympathy
      with, as well as for, the young, they have a pensive satisfaction in
      feeling and depicting the full pathos of a tragedy, and on the other hand
      they delight in their own mirth, and fully share it with the beings of
      their imagination, or they work out great questions with the unhesitating
      decision of their youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      But those who write in elder years look on at their young people, not with
      inner sympathy but from the outside. Their affections and comprehension
      are with the fathers, mothers, and aunts; they dread, rather than seek,
      piteous scenes, and they have learnt that there are two sides to a
      question, that there are many stages in human life, and that the success
      or failure of early enthusiasm leaves a good deal more yet to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the vivid fancy passes away, which the young are carried along with,
      and the older feel refreshed by; there is still a sense of experience, and
      a pleasure in tracing the perspective from another point of sight, where
      what was once distant has become near at hand, the earnest of many a
      day-dream has been gained, and more than one ideal has been tried, and
      merits and demerits have become apparent.
    </p>
    <p>
      And thus it is hoped that the Long Vacation may not be devoid of interest
      for readers who have sympathized in early days with Beechcroft,
      Stoneborough, and Vale Leston, when they were peopled with the outcome of
      a youthful mind, and that they may be ready to look with interest on the
      perplexities and successes attending on the matured characters in after
      years.
    </p>
    <p>
      If they will feel as if they were on a visit to friends grown older, with
      their children about them, and if the young will forgive the seeing with
      elder eyes, and observing instead of participating, that is all the
      veteran author would ask.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I. &mdash; A CHAPTER OF RETROSPECT
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Sorrow He gives and pain, good store;
     Toil to bear, for the neck which bore;
     For duties rendered, a duty more;
     And lessons spelled in the painful lore
       Of a war which is waged eternally.&mdash;ANON.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! my Gerald boy! There you are! Quite well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gerald Underwood, of slight delicate mould, with refined,
      transparent-looking features, and with hair and budding moustache too fair
      for his large dark eyes, came bounding up the broad stair, to the embrace
      of the aunt who stood at the top, a little lame lady supported by an
      ivory-headed staff. Her deep blue eyes, dark eyebrows, and sweet though
      piquant face were framed by the straight crape line of widowhood, whence a
      soft white veil hung on her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cherie sweet! You are well? And the Vicar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Getting on. How are they all at Vale Leston?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. Your mother got to church on Easter-day.&rdquo; This was to Anna
      Vanderkist, a young person of the plump partridge order, and fair, rosy
      countenance ever ready for smiles and laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here are no end of flowers,&rdquo; as the butler brought a hamper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daffodils! Oh!&mdash;and anemones! How delicious! I must take Clement a
      bunch of those dear white violets. I know where they came from,&rdquo; and she
      held them to her lips. &ldquo;Some primroses too, I hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A few; but the main body, tied up in tight bunches like cauliflowers, I
      dropped at Kensington Palace Gardens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A yellow primrose is much more than a yellow primrose at present,&rdquo; said
      Mrs. Grinstead, picking out the few spared from political purposes.
      &ldquo;Clement will want his button-hole, to greet Lance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he is advanced to button-holes! And Lance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is coming up for the Press dinner, and will sleep here, to be ready
      for Primrose-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s prime, whatever brings him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, children, go and <i>do</i> the flowers, and drink tea. I am going
      to read to your uncle to keep him fresh for Lance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How bright she looks,&rdquo; said Gerald, as Anna began collecting vases from
      the tables in a drawing-room not professionally artistic, but entirely
      domestic, and full of grace and charm of taste, looking over a suburban
      garden fresh with budding spring to a church spire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The thought of Uncle Lance has cheered them both very much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So the Vicar is really recovering?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since Cousin Marilda flew at the curates, and told them that if they came
      near him with their worries, they should never see a farthing of hers! And
      they are all well at home? Is anything going on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chiefly defence of the copses from primrose marauders. You know the great
      agitation. They want to set up a china clay factory on Penbeacon, and turn
      the Ewe, not to say the Leston, into milk and water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wretches! But they can&rsquo;t. It is yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the western quarry; but they cannot get the stream without a piece of
      the land which belongs to Hodnet&rsquo;s farm, for which they make astounding
      bids; but, any way, nothing can be done till I am of age, when the lease
      to Hodnet is out, except by Act of Parliament, which is hardly worth
      while, considering&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you are near twenty. But surely you won&rsquo;t consent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t want to break all your hearts, Cherie&rsquo;s especially, but why
      should all that space be nothing but a playground for us Underwoods,
      instead of making work for the million?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a horrid, nasty million it would be,&rdquo; retorted Anna. &ldquo;You born
      Yankee! Don&rsquo;t worry Aunt Cherry about profaning the Ewe, just to spoil
      good calico with nasty yellow dust.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to worry her, but there never were such groovy people as you
      are! I shall think it over, and make up my mind by the time I have the
      power.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you had to wait till five-and-twenty, so as to get more time and
      sense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gerald laughed, and sauntered away. He was not Yankee, except that he had
      been born at Boston. His father was English, his mother a Hungarian
      singer, who had divorced and deserted his father, the ne&rsquo;er-do-weel second
      son of an old family. When Gerald was five years old his father was
      killed, and he himself severely injured, in a raid of the Indians far
      west, and he was brought home by an old friend of the family. His eldest
      uncle&rsquo;s death made him heir to the estate, but his life was a very frail
      one till his thirteenth year, when he seemed to have outgrown the shock to
      spine and nerves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much had befallen the house of Underwood since the days when we took leave
      of them, still sorrowing under the loss of the main pillar of their house,
      but sending forth the new founders with good hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Geraldine had made her home at St. Matthew&rsquo;s with her brother Clement and
      the little delicate orphan Gerald; but after three years she had yielded
      to the persevering constancy of Mr. Grinstead, a sculptor of considerable
      genius and repute, much older than herself, who was ready and willing to
      be a kind uncle to her little charge, and who introduced her to all at
      home or abroad that was refined, intellectual, or beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in the first summer after their marriage that he was charmed with
      the vivacity and musical talent of her young sister Angela, now upon the
      world again. Angela had grown up as the pet and plaything of the Sisters
      of St. Faith&rsquo;s at Dearport, which she regarded as another home, and when
      crushed by grief at her eldest brother&rsquo;s death had hurried thither for
      solace. Her family thought her safe there, not realizing how far life is
      from having its final crisis over at one-and-twenty. New Sisters came in,
      old ones went to found fresh branches; stricter rules grew, up, and were
      enforced by a Superior out of sympathy with the girl, who had always
      rebelled against what she thought dictation. It was decided that she could
      stay there no longer, and her brother Lancelot and his wife received her
      at Marshlands with indignant sympathy for her wrongs; but neither she nor
      her sister-in-law were made to suit one another. With liberty her spirit
      and audacity revived, and she showed so much attraction towards the
      Salvation Army, that her brother declared their music to have been the
      chief deterrent from her becoming a &ldquo;Hallelujah lass.&rdquo; However, in a brief
      visit to London, she so much pleased Mr. Grinstead that he invited her to
      partake in the winter&rsquo;s journey to Italy. Poor man, he little knew what he
      undertook. Music, art, Roman Catholic services, and novelty conspired to
      intoxicate her, and her sister was thankful to carry her off northward
      before she had pledged herself to enter a convent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mountain air and scenery, however, proved equally dangerous. Her
      enterprises inspired the two quiet people with constant fears for her
      neck; but it was worse when they fell in with a party of very Bohemian
      artists, whom Mr. Grinstead knew just well enough not to be able to shake
      them off. The climax came when she started off with them in costume at
      daybreak on an expedition to play the zither and sing at a village fete.
      She came back safe and sound, but Geraldine was already packed up to take
      her to Munich, where Charles Audley and Stella now were, and to leave her
      under their charge before she had driven Mr. Grinstead distracted.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a worse trouble at home. Since the death of his good old mother
      and of Felix Underwood, Sir Adrian Vanderkist had been rapidly going
      downhill; as though he had thrown off all restraint, and as if the yearly
      birth of a daughter left him the more free to waste his patrimony. Little
      or nothing had been heard direct from poor Alda till Clement was summoned
      by a telegram from Ironbeam Park to find his sister in the utmost danger,
      with a new-born son by her side, and her husband in the paroxysms of the
      terrible Nemesis of indulgence in alcohol.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Adrian had quarrelled with all the family in turn except Clement, and
      this fact, or else that gentleness towards a sufferer that had won on old
      Fulbert Underwood, led him in a lucid interval to direct and sign a
      hurried will, drawn up by his steward, leaving the Reverend Edward Clement
      Underwood sole guardian to his children, and executor, together with his
      lawyer. It was done without Clement&rsquo;s knowledge, or he would have
      remonstrated, for never was there a more trying bequest than the charge
      which in a few days he found laid on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had of course already made acquaintance with the little girls. Poor
      children, they had hitherto led a life as dreary as was possible to
      children who had each other, and fresh air and open grounds. Their mother
      was more and more of an invalid, and dreaded that their father should take
      umbrage at the least expense that they caused; so that they were
      scrupulously kept out of his way, fed, dressed, and even educated as
      plainly as possible by a governess, cheap because she was passe, and made
      up for her deficiencies by strictness amounting to harshness, while they
      learnt to regard each new little sister&rsquo;s sex as a proof of naughtiness on
      her part or theirs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first time they ever heard a man&rsquo;s step in the school-room passage was
      in those days of undefined sorrow, alarm, and silence after the governess
      had despatched the message to the only relation whose address she knew.
      The step came nearer; there was a knock, the sweet, strong voice asked,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are the poor little girls here?&rdquo; and the tall figure was on one knee
      among them, gathering as many as he could within his loving arms. Perhaps
      he recollected Sister Constance among the forlorn flock at Bexley; but
      these were even more desolate, for they had no past of love and loyalty.
      But with that embrace it seemed to the four elders that their worst days
      were over. What mattered it to them that they all eight of them&mdash;were
      almost destitute? the birth of the poor little male heir preventing the
      sale of the property, so terribly encumbered; and the only available
      maintenance being the £5000 that Mr. Thomas Underwood had settled securely
      upon their mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      They began to know what love and kindness meant. Kind uncles and aunts
      gathered round them. Their mother seemed to be able to live when her
      twin-sister hung over her, and as soon as she could be moved, the whole
      party left the gloom of Ironbeam for Vale Leston, where a house was
      arranged for them. Lady Vanderkist continued a chronic invalid, watched
      over by her sister Wilmet and her excellent young daughter Mary. Robina,
      who had only one girl, and had not forgotten her training as a teacher,
      undertook, with the assistance of Sophia, the second daughter, the
      education of the little ones; and the third and fourth, Emilia and Anna,
      were adopted into the childless homes of Mrs. Travis Underwood and Mrs.
      Grinstead, and lived there as daughters. Business cares of the most
      perplexing kind fell, however, on Clement Underwood&rsquo;s devoted and
      unaccustomed head, and in the midst arrived a telegram from Charles
      Audley, summoning him instantly to Munich.
    </p>
    <p>
      Angela was in danger of fulfilling her childish design of marrying a Duke,
      or at least a Graf. Diplomates could not choose their society, and she had
      utterly disdained all restraints from &ldquo;the babies,&rdquo; as she chose to call
      Mr. and Mrs. Audley, and thus the wunderschones madchen had fascinated the
      Count, an unbelieving Roman Catholic of evil repute, and had derided their
      remonstrances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clement hurried off, but to find the bird flown. She had come down in the
      morning, white and tear-stained, and had told Stella that she could stay
      no longer, kissed her, and was gone out of the house before even Charles
      could be called. Stella&rsquo;s anxiety, almost despair, had however been
      relieved just before her brother&rsquo;s arrival by an electric message from
      Vale Leston with the words, &ldquo;Angela safe at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Letters followed, and told how Robina had found her sobbing upon her
      brother Felix&rsquo;s grave. Her explanation was, that on the very night before
      her proposed betrothal, she had dreamt that she was drifting down the Ewe
      in the little boat Miss Ullin, and saw Felix under the willow-tree holding
      out his bared arms to her. She said, &ldquo;Is that the scar of the scald?&rdquo; and
      his only answer was the call &ldquo;Angela! Angela!&rdquo; and with the voice still
      sounding in her ears, she awoke, and determined instantly to obey the
      call, coming to her, as she felt, from another world. If it were only from
      her own conscience, still it was a cause of great thankfulness to her
      family, and she soon made herself very valuable at Vale Leston in a course
      of epidemics which ran through the village, and were in some cases very
      severe. The doctors declared that two of the little Vanderkists owed their
      lives to her unremitting care.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her destiny seemed to be fixed, and she went off radiant to be trained at
      a London hospital as a nurse. Her faculty in that line was undoubted. All
      the men in her ward were devoted to her, and so were almost all the young
      doctors; but the matron did not like her, and at the end of the three
      years, an act of independent treatment of a patient caused a tremendous
      commotion, all the greater because many outsiders declared that she was
      right. But it almost led to a general expulsion of lady nurses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course she had to retire, and happily for her, Mother Constance was
      just at that time sentenced by her rheumatism to spend the winter in a
      warm climate. She eagerly claimed Angela&rsquo;s tendance, and just at the end
      of the year there came an urgent request for a Sister from England to form
      a foundation in one of the new cities of Australia on the model of St.
      Faith&rsquo;s; and thither Mother Constance proceeded, with one Sister and
      Angela, who had thenceforth gone on so well and quietly that her family
      hoped the time for Angela&rsquo;s periodical breaking out had passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ensuing years had been tranquil as to family events, though the
      various troubles and perplexities that fell on Clement were endless, both
      those parochial and ritualistic, and those connected with the Vanderkist
      affairs, where his sister did not spare him her murmurs. Fulbert&rsquo;s death
      in Australia was a blow both to Lancelot and to him, though they had never
      had much hope of seeing this brother again. He had left the proceeds of
      his sheep-farm between Lancelot, Bernard, and Angela.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus had passed about fourteen years since the death of Felix, when kind
      old Mr. Grinstead died suddenly at a public meeting, leaving his widow
      well endowed, and the possessor of her pretty home at Brompton. When, soon
      after the blow, her sisters took her to the home at Vale Leston, she had
      seemed oppressed by the full tide of young life overflowing there, and as
      if she again felt the full force of the early sorrow in the loss that she
      had once said made Vale Leston to her a desolation. On her return to
      Brompton, she had still been in a passive state, as though the taste of
      life had gone from her, and there was nothing to call forth her interest
      or energy. The first thing that roused her was the dangerous illness of
      her brother Clement, the result of blood-poisoning during a mission week
      in a pestilential locality, after a long course of family worries and
      overwork in his parish. Low, lingering fever had threatened every organ in
      turn, till in the early days of January, a fatal time in the family, he
      was almost despaired of. However, Dr. Brownlow and Lancelot Underwood had
      strength of mind to run the risk, with the earnest co-operation of
      Professor Tom May, of a removal to Brompton, where he immediately began to
      mend, so that he was in April decidedly convalescent, though with doubts
      as to a return to real health, nor had he yet gone beyond his
      dressing-room, since any exertion was liable to cause fainting.

      CHAPTER II. &mdash; A CHAPTER OF TWADDLE
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     The blessing of my later years
     Was with me when a boy.&mdash;WORDSWORTH.
</pre>
    <p>
      When Mrs. Grinstead, on her nephew&rsquo;s arm, came into her drawing-room after
      dinner, she was almost as much dismayed as pleased to find a long black
      figure in a capacious arm-chair by the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You adventurous person,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;how came you here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could not help it, with the prospect of Lancey boy,&rdquo; he said in smiling
      excuse, holding out a hand in greeting to Gerald, and thanking Anna, who
      brought a cushion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hark! there he is!&rdquo; and Gerald and Anna sprang forward, but were only in
      time to open the room door, when there was a double cry of greeting, not
      only of the slender, bright-eyed, still youthful-looking uncle, but of the
      pleasant face of his wife. She exclaimed as Lancelot hung over his brother&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, I would not have come but that I thought he was still in his
      room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a very bad compliment, Gertrude, when I have just made my escape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be too much for you,&rdquo; said Gertrude. &ldquo;Here, children, take me off
      somewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To have some dinner,&rdquo; said Geraldine, her hand on the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, Marilda feasted me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; entreated Clement. &ldquo;It is a treat to look at you two
      sunny people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us efface ourselves, and be seen and not heard,&rdquo; returned Gertrude,
      sitting down between Gerald and Anna on a distant couch, whence she
      contemplated the trio&mdash;Clement, of course, with the extreme pallor,
      languor, and emaciation of long illness, with a brow gaining in dignity
      and expression by the loss of hair, and with a look of weary, placid
      enjoyment as he listened to the talk of the other two; Lance with bright,
      sweet animation and cheeriness, still young-looking, though his hair too
      was scantier and his musical tones subdued; and Geraldine, pensive in eye
      and lip, but often sparkling up with flashes of her inborn playfulness,
      and, like Clement, resting in the sunshine diffused by Lance. This last
      was the editor and proprietor of the &lsquo;Pursuivant&rsquo;, an important local
      paper, and had come up on journalistic business as well as for the fete.
      Gertrude meantime had been choosing carpets and curtains.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For,&rdquo; said Lance, with a smack of exultation, &ldquo;we are actually going back
      to our old quarters over the shop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; A responsive sound of satisfaction from Geraldine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing amiss?&rdquo; asked Clement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Far from it. We let Marshlands to great advantage, and there are many
      reasons for the flitting. I ought to be at head-quarters, and besides
      there are the Sundays. We are too many now for picnicking in the
      class-room, or sponging on the rectory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And,&rdquo; said Gertrude, &ldquo;I dare not put his small family in competition with
      his organ.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; said Lance, &ldquo;the &lsquo;Pursuivant&rsquo; is more exacting, and the
      printing Will Harewood&rsquo;s books has brought in more business&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how about space? We could squeeze, but can you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have devoured our two next-door neighbours. There&rsquo;s for you! You know
      Pratt the dentist had a swell hall-door and staircase, which we absorb, so
      we shall not eat in the back drawing-room, nor come up the flight which
      used to be so severe on you, Cherry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can only remember the arms that helped me up. I have never left off
      dreaming of the dear old step springing up the stair after the day&rsquo;s work,
      and the whistle to Theodore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, those were the jolly old days!&rdquo; returned Lance, con amore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unbroken,&rdquo; added Clement, in the same tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better than Vale Leston?&rdquo; asked Gertrude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The five years there were, as Felix called those last hours of delight,
      halcyon days,&rdquo; said Geraldine; &ldquo;but the real home was in the rough and the
      smooth, the contrivances, the achievements, the exultation at each step on
      the ladder, the flashes of Edgar, the crowded holiday times&mdash;all
      happier than we knew! I hope your children will care as much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vale Leston is their present paradise,&rdquo; said Gertrude. &ldquo;You should see
      Master Felix&rsquo;s face at the least hope of a visit, and even little Fulbert
      talks about boat and fish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you done with the Lambs?&rdquo; demanded Clement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have outgrown the old place in every direction, and have got a
      spick-and-span chess-board of a villa out on the Minsterham road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have not more children than you have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five Lambkins to our four, besides Gussy and Killy,&rdquo; said Lance; &ldquo;though
      A&mdash;which is all that appears of the great Achilles&rsquo; unlucky name&mdash;is
      articled to Shapcote, and as for Gussy, or rather Mr. Tanneguy, he is my
      right hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We thought him a nice sort of youth when he was improving himself in
      London,&rdquo; said Clement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You both were very good to him,&rdquo; said Lance, &ldquo;and those three years were
      not wasted. He is a far better sub-editor and reporter than I was at his
      age, with his French wit and cleverness. The only fault I find with him is
      that he longs for plate-glass and flummery instead of old Froggatt&rsquo;s
      respectable panes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has become the London assistant, who was our bugbear,&rdquo; said Geraldine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how we should get on without him since we made &lsquo;Pur&rsquo; daily,&rdquo;
       said Lance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How old ambitions get realized!&rdquo; said Geraldine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does his mother endure the retail work, or has she not higher views for
      him?&rdquo; asked Clement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In fact, ever since the first Lambkin came on the stage any one would
      have thought those poor boys were her steps, not good old Lamb&rsquo;s; whereas
      Felix always made a point of noticing them. Gus was nine years old that
      last time he was there, while I was ill, and he left such an impression as
      to make him the hero model.&mdash;Aye, Gus is first-rate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad you have not altered the old shop and office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Catch me! But we are enlarging the reading-room, and the new press
      demands space. Then there&rsquo;s a dining-room for the young men, and what do
      you think I&rsquo;ve got? We (not Froggatt, Underwood, and Lamb, but the Church
      Committee) have bought St. Oswald&rsquo;s buildings for a coffee hotel and young
      men&rsquo;s lodging-house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our own, old house. Oh! is Edgar&rsquo;s Great Achilles there still?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I rushed up to see. Alas! the barbarians have papered him out. But what
      do you think I&rsquo;ve got? The old cupboard door where all our heights were
      marked on our birthdays.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He set it up in his office,&rdquo; said Gertrude. &ldquo;I think he danced round it.
      I know he brought me and all the children to adore it, and showed us, just
      like a weather record, where every one shot up after the measles, and
      where Clement got above you, Cherry, and Lance remained a bonny shrimp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A great move, but it sounds comfortable,&rdquo; said Clement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; for now Lance will get a proper luncheon, as he never has done since
      dear old Mrs. Froggatt died,&rdquo; said Gertrude, &ldquo;and he is an animal that
      needs to be made to eat! Then the children want schooling of the
      new-fashioned kinds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All this had become possible through Fulbert&rsquo;s legacy between his brothers
      and unmarried sister, resulting in about £4000 apiece; besides which the
      firm had gone on prospering. Clement asked what was the present
      circulation of the &lsquo;Pursuivant&rsquo;, and as Lance named it, exclaimed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would old Froggatt have said, or even Felix?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is his doing,&rdquo; said Lance, &ldquo;the lines he traced out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father says it is the writing with a conscience,&rdquo; said Gertrude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, with life, faculty, and point, so as to hinder the conscience from
      being a dead weight,&rdquo; added Geraldine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No wonder,&rdquo; said Lance, &ldquo;with such contributors as the Harewoods, and
      such a war-correspondent as Aubrey May.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then the door began to open, and a black silk personage
      disconsolately exclaimed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Master Clement! Master Clem! Wherever is the boy gone, when he ought to
      be in his bed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, Sibby!&rdquo; cried Lance, catching both hands, and kissing the cheery,
      withered-apple cheeks of the old nurse. &ldquo;You see your baby has begun to
      run alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Master Lance, &lsquo;twas your doing. You always was the mischief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No indeed, Sibby, the long boy did it all by himself, before ever I was
      in the house; but I&rsquo;ll bring him back again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I not stay a little longer, Sibby,&rdquo; said Clement, rather piteously,
      &ldquo;to hear Lance sing? I have been looking forward to it all day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If ye&rsquo;ll take yer jelly, sir,&rdquo; said Sibby, &ldquo;as it&rsquo;s fainting ye&rsquo;ll be,
      and bringing our hearts into our mouths.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Sibby administered her jelly, and heard histories of Lance&rsquo;s children,
      then, after exacting a promise that Master Lance should only sing once,
      she withdrew, as peremptory and almost as happy as in her once crowded
      nursery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall that once be, Clem?&rdquo; asked Lance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Lead, kindly Light.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it not too much?&rdquo; he inquired, glancing towards his widowed sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want it as much as he does,&rdquo; she answered fervently.
    </p>
    <p>
      At thirty-eight Lance&rsquo;s voice was, if possible, more perfect in sweetness,
      purity, and expression than it had been at twenty, and never had the poem,
      connected with all the crises of their joint lives, come more home to
      their hearts, filling them with aspiration as well as memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Lance helped his brother up, and was surprised, after those cheerful
      tones, to feel the weight so prone and feeble, that Gerald&rsquo;s support on
      the other side was welcome. Mrs. Grinstead followed to take Gertrude to
      her room and find her children&rsquo;s photographs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two young people began to smile as soon as they were left alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever see Bexley?&rdquo; asked Anna.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;an awful hole,&rdquo; and both indulged in a merry laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother mentions it with pious horror,&rdquo; said Anna.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Life is much more interesting when it is from hand to mouth,&rdquo; said
      Gerald, with a yawn. &ldquo;If I went in for sentiment, which I don&rsquo;t, it would
      be for Fiddler&rsquo;s Ranch; though it is now a great city called Violinia,
      with everything like everything else everywhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not Uncle Lance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not. For a man with that splendid talent to bury it behind a
      counter, mitigated by a common church organ, is as remarkable as absurd;
      though he seems to thrive on it. It is a treat to see such innocent
      rapture, all genuine too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You worn-out old man!&rdquo; laughed Anna. &ldquo;Aunt Cherry has always said that
      self-abnegation is the secret of Uncle Lance&rsquo;s charm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All very well in that generation&mdash;ces bons jours quand nous etions
      si miserables,&rdquo; said Gerald, in his low, maundering voice. &ldquo;Prosperity
      means the lack of object.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In these days when everything is used up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to those two&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Happy folk, never to lose the sense of achievement!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor old man! You talk as if you were twenty years older than Uncle
      Lance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sometimes think I am, and that I left my youth at Fiddler&rsquo;s Ranch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wherewith he strolled to the piano, and began to improvise something so
      yearning and melancholy that Anna was not sorry when her uncle came back
      and mentioned the tune the old cow died of.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was Gerald, the orphan of Fiddler&rsquo;s Ranch, to be always the spoilt child
      of prosperity and the creature of modern life, with more aspirations than
      he saw how to fulfil, hampered as he was by duties, scruples, and
      affections?

      CHAPTER III. &mdash; DARBY AND JOAN
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                        My reason haply more
     To bandy word for word and frown for frown;
     But now I see our lances are but straws!
                                        SHAKESPEARE.
</pre>
    <p>
      Lancelot saw his brother&rsquo;s doctors the next morning, and communicated to
      his wife the upshot of the interview when they were driving to their
      meeting in Mrs. Grinstead&rsquo;s victoria, each adorned with a big bunch of
      primroses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two doctors! and not Tom,&rdquo; said Gertrude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Both Brownlows. Tom knows them well, and wrote. One lives at the
      East-end, and is sheet anchor to Whittingtonia. He began with Clement, but
      made the case over to the cousin, the fashionable one, when we made the
      great removal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So they consulted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And fairly see the way out of the wood, though not by any means quit of
      it, poor Tina; but there&rsquo;s a great deal to be thankful for,&rdquo; said Lance,
      with a long breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed there is!&rdquo; said the wife, with a squeeze of the hand. &ldquo;But is
      there any more to be feared?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything,&rdquo; Lance answered; &ldquo;heart chiefly, but the lungs are not safe.
      He has been whirling his unfortunate machine faster and faster, till no
      wonder the mainspring has all but broken down. His ideal always was
      working himself to death, and only Felix could withhold him, so now he has
      fairly run himself down. No rest from that tremendous parish work, with
      the bothers about curates, school boards and board schools, and the
      threatened ritual prosecution, which came to nothing, but worried him
      almost as much as if it had gone on, besides all the trouble about poor
      Alda, and the loss of Fulbert took a great deal out of him. When Somers
      got a living, there was no one to look after him, and he never took
      warning. So when in that Stinksmeech Mission he breathed pestiferous air
      and drank pestiferous water, he was finished up. They&rsquo;ve got typhus down
      there&mdash;a very good thing too,&rdquo; he added vindictively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I put it further back than Mr. Somers&rsquo; going,&rdquo; said Gertrude. &ldquo;He never
      was properly looked after since Cherry married. What is he to do now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just nothing. If he wishes to live or have a chance of working again, he
      must go to the seaside and vegetate, attempt nothing for the next six
      months, nor even think about St. Matthew&rsquo;s for a year, and, as they told
      me afterwards, be only able to go on cautiously even then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did he take it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He laid his head against Cherry, who was standing by his chair, put an
      arm round her, and said, &lsquo;There!&rsquo; and she gave him such a smile as I would
      not have missed seeing on any account. &lsquo;Mine now,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;Best!&rsquo; he
      said. He is too much tired and worn out to vex himself about anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are they to go? Not to Ewmouth, or all the family worries would
      come upon them. Alda would give him no peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not there. Brownlow advises Rockquay. His delicate brother is a
      curate there, and it agrees with him better than any other place. So I am
      to go and see for a house for them. It is the very best thing for Cherry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed it is. Was not she like herself last night? Anna says she has
      never brightened up so much before! I do believe that if Clement goes on
      mending, the dear person will have a good time yet; nay, all the better
      now that she is free to be a thorough-going Underwood again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You Underwooder than Underwood!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly! I never did like&mdash;Yes, Lance, I am going to have it out. I
      do think Clement would have done better to let her alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did let her alone. He told me so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but she let out to me the difference between that time and the one
      of the first offer when dear Felix could not keep back his delight at
      keeping her; whereas she could not help seeing that she was a burthen on
      Clement&rsquo;s soul, between fear of neglecting her and that whirl of parish
      work, and that St. Wulstan&rsquo;s Hall was wanted for the girls&rsquo; school.
      Besides, Wilmet persuaded her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She did. But it turned out well. The old man worshipped her, and she was
      very fond of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! very well in a way, but you know better, Lance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, perhaps he did not begin young enough. He was a good, religious
      man, but Pro Ecclesia Dei had not been his war-cry from his youth, and he
      did not understand, and thought it clerical; good, but outside his life.
      Still, she was happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Petting, Society, Art, travels! I had rather have had our two first years
      of tiffs than all that sort of happiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tiffs! I thought we might have gone in for the Dunmow flitch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might! Do you mean that you forget how fractious and nasty and
      abominable I was, and how many headaches I gave you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only what you had to put up with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t recollect that first visit of my father&rsquo;s, when I was so
      frightfully cross because you said we must ask the Lambs and Bruces to
      dinner? You came down in the morning white as a ghost, an owl in its
      blinkers, and though I know you would rather have died than have uttered a
      word, no sooner were you off than he fell upon me with, &lsquo;Mrs. Daisy, I
      give you to understand that you haven&rsquo;t a husband made of such tough
      commodity as you are used to at home, and if you worry him you will have
      to rue it.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an ass I must have looked! Did I really go playing the martyr?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very smiling martyr, pretending to be awfully jolly. I believe I
      requited papa by being very cross.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At his interfering, eh? No wonder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chiefly to conceal my fright, but I did begin trying not to fly out as I
      used to do, and I was frightened whenever I did so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Daisy! That is why you always seemed to think every headache your
      fault.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The final effect&mdash;I won&rsquo;t say cure&mdash;was from that book on
      education which said that a child should never know a cross word or look
      between father and mother. So you really have forgotten how horrid I could
      be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or never felt it! But to return to our muttons. I can&rsquo;t believe otherwise
      than that Cherry liked her old man, and if their parallel lines did not
      meet, she never found it out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true. She liked him and leant on him, and was constantly pleased
      and amused as well as idolized, but I don&rsquo;t think the deep places in her
      heart were stirred. Then there were constraints. He could not stand
      Angela&rsquo;s freaks. And his politics&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was not so very much advanced.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough not to like the &lsquo;Pursuivant&rsquo; to lie about, nor her writing for it,
      even about art or books; nor did his old bones enjoy the rivers at Vale
      Leston. Now you will see a rebound.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or will she be too tender of him to do what he disliked?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will be the test. Now she has Clement, I expect an article will come
      on the first book they read together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lance laughed, but returned to defend his sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed she was attached to him. She was altogether drooping and crushed
      at Vale Leston in the autumn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was too soon. She was overdone with the multitudes, and in fact it was
      more the renewal of the old sorrow than the new one. Anna tells me that
      when they returned there was the same objectless depression. She would not
      take up her painting again, she said it was of no use, there was no one to
      care. I remember her being asked once to do something for the Kyrle
      Society, and Mr. Grinstead did not like it, but now Clement&rsquo;s illness has
      made a break, and in a new place, with him to occupy her instead of only
      that dawdling boy, you will see what you shall see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Gerald!&rdquo; was the answer, in a doubtful, wistful tone, just as they
      arrived.

      CHAPTER IV. &mdash; SLUM, SEA, OR SEASON
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     For in spite of all her mother had taught her,
     She was really remarkably fond of the water.
                                            JANE TAYLOR.
</pre>
    <p>
      Mr. and Mrs. Lancelot Underwood had not long been gone to their meeting
      when there ran into the drawing-room a girl a year older than Anna, with a
      taller, better figure, but a less clear complexion, namely Emilia, the
      adopted child of Mr. Travis Underwood. She found Anna freshening up the
      flowers, and Gerald in an arm-chair reading a weekly paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew I should find you,&rdquo; she cried, kissing Anna, while Gerald held out
      a finger or two without rising. &ldquo;I thought you would not be gone
      primrosing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A perspicacity that does you credit,&rdquo; said Gerald, still behind his
      paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are the cousins gone?&rdquo; asked Anna.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course they are; Cousin Marilda, in a bonnet like a primrose bank, is
      to pick up Fernan somewhere, but I told her I was too true to my
      principles to let wild horses drag me there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let alone fat tame ones,&rdquo; ejaculated Gerald.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did she say?&rdquo; asked Anna.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, she opened her eyes, and said she never should ask any one to act
      against principles, but principles in her time were for Church and State.
      Is Aunt Cherry in the vortex?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she is reading to Uncle Clem, or about the house somewhere. I don&rsquo;t
      think she would go now at least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Grin&rsquo;s memory would forbid,&rdquo; muttered Gerald. &ldquo;He saw a good many
      things, though he was a regular old-fashioned Whig, an Edinburgh Review
      man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got the &lsquo;Censor&rsquo; there! Oh, let me see it. My respected cousins
      don&rsquo;t think it good for little girls. What are you going to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe the doctors want Uncle Clem to get a long leave of absence, and
      that we shall go to the seaside,&rdquo; replied Anna.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! then you will come to us for the season! We reckon on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed, Emmie, I don&rsquo;t see how I can. Those two are not in the least
      fit to go without some one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But then mother is reckoning on our having a season together. You lost
      the last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gerald laughed a little and hummed&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;If I were na to marry a rich sodger lad
           My friends would be dismal, my minnie be mad.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so disgusting, Gerald! My friends have too much sense,&rdquo; cried
      Anna.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is true enough as regards &lsquo;my minnie,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Emilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, eight daughters <i>are</i> serious&mdash;baronet&rsquo;s daughters!&rdquo;
       observed Gerald in his teasing voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tocherless lasses without even the long pedigree,&rdquo; laughed Anna. &ldquo;Poor
      mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The pedigree is long enough to make her keep poor Vale Leston suitors at
      arm&rsquo;s length,&rdquo; mumbled Gerald; but the sisters did not hear him, for
      Emilia was exclaiming&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean to be a worker. I shall make Marilda let me have hospital
      training, and either go out to Aunt Angela or have a hospital here. Come
      and help me, Annie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a hospital here,&rdquo; laughed Anna.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Nan dear, do come! You know such lots of swells. You would get one
      into real society if one is to have it; Lady Rotherwood, Lady Caergwent,
      besides all your delightful artist friends; and that would pacify mother,
      and make it so much pleasanter for me. Oh, if you knew what the evenings
      are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an inducement!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would not be so if Annie were there. We should go out, and miss the
      horrid aldermanic kind of dinners; and at home, when we had played the two
      old dears to sleep, as I have to do every night, while they nod over their
      piquet or backgammon, we could have some fun together! Now, Annie, you
      would like it. You do care for good society, now don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did enjoy it very much when Aunt Cherry went with me, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No buts, no buts. You would come to the laundry girls, and the
      cooking-class, and all the rest with me, and we should not have a dreary
      moment. Have you done fiddling over those flowers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet; Vale Leston flowers, you know. Besides, Aunt Cherry can&rsquo;t bear
      them not artistic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tidy is enough for Marilda. She does them herself, or the housekeeper; I
      can&rsquo;t waste time worrying over them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the reason they always look like a gardener&rsquo;s prize bouquet at a
      country horticultural show,&rdquo; said Gerald.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does it signify? They are only a testimony to Sir Gorgias Midas&rsquo; 
      riches. I do hate orchids.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish them on their native rocks, poor things,&rdquo; said Gerald. &ldquo;But poor
      Fernan, you do him an injustice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, he does quantities of good works, and so does Marilda, till I am
      quite sick of hearing of them! The piles of begging letters they get! And
      then they want them read and explained, and answered sometimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A means of good works,&rdquo; observed Gerald.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How would you like it? Docketing the crumbs from Dives&rsquo; table,&rdquo; exclaimed
      Emilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A clerk or secretary could do it,&rdquo; said Anna.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. Now if you have finished those flowers, do come out with me. I
      want to go into Ponter&rsquo;s Court, and Fernan won&rsquo;t let me go alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any special object?&rdquo; said Gerald lazily, &ldquo;or is it to refresh
      yourself with the atmosphere?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That dear boy&mdash;that Silky&mdash;has been taken up, and they&rsquo;ve sent
      him to a reformatory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a good thing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, only I don&rsquo;t believe he did it! It was that nasty little Bill Nosey.
      I am sure that he got hold of the lady&rsquo;s parcel, and stuffed it into
      Silky&rsquo;s cap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emilia spoke with a vehemence that made them both laugh, and Gerald said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if he is in a reformatory, what then? Are we to condole with his
      afflicted family, or bring Bill Nosey to confess?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I would see about it,&rdquo; said Emilia vaguely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I decline to walk in the steps of the police as an amateur! How
      about the Dicksons?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drifted away no one knows where. That&rsquo;s the worst of it. Those poor
      things do shift about so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I thought we had got hold of those boys with the gymnasium. But work
      wants regulating.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Gerald, I am glad you are coming. Now I am free! Just fancy, they had
      a horrid, stupid, slow dinner-party on Easter Monday, of all the
      burgomasters and great One-eyers, and would not let me go down and sing to
      the match-girls!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had the pleasure of a study of the follies of wealth instead of the
      follies of poverty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, to hear Mrs. Brown discourse on her troubles with her first, second,
      and third coachman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was the irresistible Ferdinand Brown there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed, with diamond beetle studs and a fresh twist to his
      moustache. It has grown long enough to be waxed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How happy that fellow would be if he were obliged to dig! I should like
      to scatter his wardrobe over Ponter&rsquo;s Court.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, Nan, have you finished?&rdquo; as Anna swept the scattered leaves into a
      basket. &ldquo;Are you coming?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I shall. You would only talk treason&mdash;well&mdash;social
      treason all the way, and you don&rsquo;t want me, and Aunt Cherry would have to
      lunch alone, unless you wait till after.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no, I know a scrumptious place for lunch,&rdquo; said Gerald. &ldquo;You are
      right, Annie, one lady is quite enough on one&rsquo;s hands in such regions. You
      have no jewellery, Emmie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you see any verdure about me?&rdquo; she retorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      So when Gerald&rsquo;s tardy movements had been overcome, off they started to
      their beloved slum, Emilia looking as if she were setting forth for
      Elysium, and they were seen no more, even when five o&rsquo;clock tea was
      spread, and Anna making it for her Uncle Lance and his wife, who had just
      returned, full of political news; and likewise Lance said that he had
      picked up some intelligence for his sister. He had met General Mohun and
      Sir Jasper Merrifield, both connections of the Underwoods.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Mohun lived with his sister at Rockstone, Sir Jasper, his
      brother-in-law, at Clipstone, not far off, and they both recommended
      Rockquay and its bay &ldquo;with as much praise,&rdquo; said Lance, &ldquo;as the
      inhabitants ever give of a sea place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, except for the visitors,&rdquo; said Geraldine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly so. Over-built, over-everythinged, but still tolerable. The
      General lives there with his sister, and promises to write to me about
      houses, and Sir Jasper in a house a few miles off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is Bernard&rsquo;s father-in-law?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Gertrude; &ldquo;and my brother Harry married a sister of Lady
      Merrifield, a most delightful person as ever I saw. We tell my father that
      if she were not out in New Zealand we should all begin to be jealous, he
      is so enthusiastic about Phyllis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have never told us how Dr. May is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not easy to persuade him that he is not as young as he was,&rdquo; said
      Gertrude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say he was,&rdquo; observed Lance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In heart&mdash;that&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said Gertrude; &ldquo;but he does get tired, and
      goes to sleep a good deal, but he likes to go and see his old patients, as
      much as they like to have him, and Ethel is always looking after him. It
      is just her life now that Cocksmoor has grown so big and wants her less.
      Things do settle themselves. If any one had told her twenty years ago that
      Richard would have a great woollen factory living, and Cocksmoor and
      Stoneborough meet, and a separate parish be made, with a disgusting
      paper-mill, two churches, and a clergyman&rsquo;s wife&mdash;(what&rsquo;s the female
      of whipper-snapper, Lance?)&mdash;who treats her as&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As an extinct volcano,&rdquo; murmured Lance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She would have thought her heart would be broken,&rdquo; pursued Gertrude.
      &ldquo;Whereas now she owns that it is the best thing, and a great relief, for
      she could not attend to Cocksmoor and my father both. We want her to take
      a holiday, but she never will. Once she did when Blanche and Hector came
      to stay, but he was not happy, hardly well, and I don&rsquo;t think she will
      ever leave him again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Rivers is working still in London?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes; I don&rsquo;t know what the charities of all kinds and descriptions
      would do without her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Clement from his easy-chair. &ldquo;She is a most valuable person.
      She has such good judgment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has been her whole life ever since poor George Rivers&rsquo; fatal
      accident,&rdquo; said Gertrude. &ldquo;I hardly remember her before she was married,
      except a sense that I was naughty with her, and then she was terribly sad.
      But since she gave up Abbotstoke to young Dickie May she has been much
      brighter, and she can do more than any one at Cocksmoor. She manages
      Cocksmoor and London affairs in her own way, and has two houses and young
      Mrs. Dickie on her hands to boot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many societies is she chairwoman of?&rdquo; said Lance. &ldquo;I counted
      twenty-four pigeon-holes in her cabinet one day, and I believe there was a
      society for each of them; but I must say she is quiet about them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is fine to see the little hen-of-the-walk of Cocksmoor lower her crest
      to her!&rdquo; said Gertrude, &ldquo;when Ethel has not thought it worth while to
      assert herself, being conscious of being an old fogey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your Bishop?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Norman? I do believe he is coming home next year. I think he really would
      if papa begged him, but that he&mdash;my father, I mean&mdash;said he
      would never do so; though I believe nothing would be such happiness to him
      as to have Norman and Meta at home again. You know they came home on
      George&rsquo;s death, but then those New Somersetas went and chose him Bishop,
      and there he is for good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For good indeed,&rdquo; said Clement; &ldquo;he is a great power there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So are his books,&rdquo; added Geraldine. &ldquo;Will Harewood sets great store by
      them. Ah! I hear our young folks&mdash;or is that a carriage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emilia and Gerald came in simultaneously with Marilda, expanded into a
      portly matron, as good-humoured as ever, and better-looking than long ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was already insisting on Gerald&rsquo;s coming to a party of hers and
      bringing his violin, and only interrupted her persuasions to greet and
      congratulate Clement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gerald, lying back on a sofa, and looking tired, only replied in a
      bantering, lazy manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! if I asked you to play to the chimney-sweeps,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you would
      come fast enough, you idle boy. And you, Annie, do you know you are coming
      to me for the season when your uncle and aunt go out of town?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, Cousin Marilda, thank you, I don&rsquo;t know it, and I don&rsquo;t believe
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, we&rsquo;ll see! You haven&rsquo;t thought of the dresses you two are to have for
      the Drawing-Room from Worth&rsquo;s, and Lady Caergwent to present you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anna shook her head laughingly, while Gerald muttered&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Salmon are caught with gay flies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They closed round the tea-table while Marilda sighed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alda&rsquo;s daughters are not like herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A different generation,&rdquo; said Geraldine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See the Beggars Opera,&rdquo; said Lance&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;&lsquo;I wonder any man alive will ever rear a daughter,
      For when she&rsquo;s drest with care and cost, and made all neat and gay,
      As men should serve a cucumber, she throws herself away.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! your time has not come yet, Lance. Your little girls are at a
      comfortable age.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are different ways of throwing oneself away,&rdquo; said Clement.
      &ldquo;Perhaps each generation says it of the next.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Emmie is not throwing herself away, except her chances,&rdquo; said Marilda.
      &ldquo;If she would only think of poor Ferdy Brown, who is as good a fellow as
      ever lived!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much chance of that,&rdquo; said Geraldine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their eyes all met as each had glanced at the tea-table, where Emilia and
      Gerald were looking over a report together, but Geraldine shook her head.
      She was sure that Gerald did not think of his cousins otherwise than as
      sisters, but she was by no means equally sure of Emilia, to whom he was
      certainly a hero.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anna had not heard the last of the season. Her mother wrote to her, and
      also to Geraldine, whom she piteously entreated not to let Anna lose
      another chance, in the midst of her bloom, when she could get good
      introductions, and Marilda would do all she could for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Anna was obdurate. She should never see any one in society like Uncle
      Clem. She had had a taste two years ago, and she wished for no more. She
      should see the best pictures at the studios before leaving town, and she
      neither could nor would leave her uncle and aunt to themselves. So the
      matter remained in abeyance till the place of sojourn had been selected
      and tried; and meantime Gerald spent what remained of the Easter vacation
      in a little of exhibitions with Anna, a little of slumming with Emilia, a
      little of society impartially with swells and artists, and a good deal of
      amiable lounging and of modern reading of all kinds. His aunt watched,
      enjoyed, yet could not understand, his uncle said, that he was an
      undeveloped creature.

      CHAPTER V. &mdash; A HAPPY SPRITE
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Such trifles will their hearts engage,
       A shell, a flower, a feather;
     If none of these, a cup of joy
       It is to be together.&mdash;ISAAC WILLIAMS.
</pre>
    <p>
      A retired soldier, living with his sister in a watering-place, is apt to
      form to himself regular habits, of which one of the most regular is the
      walking to the station in quest of his newspaper. Here, then, it was that
      the tall, grey-haired, white-moustached General Mohun beheld, emerging on
      the platform, a slight figure in a grey suit, bag in hand, accompanied by
      a pretty pink-cheeked, fair-haired, knicker-bockered little boy, whose air
      of content and elation at being father&rsquo;s companion made his sapphire eyes
      goodly to behold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Underwood! I am glad to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I would run down and look at the house you were so good as to
      mention for my sister, and let this chap have a smell of the sea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a contention between General Mohun&rsquo;s hospitality and Lancelot&rsquo;s
      intention of leaving his bag at the railway hotel, but the former gained
      the day, the more easily because there was an assurance that the nephew
      who slept at Miss Mohun&rsquo;s for the sake of his day-school would take little
      Felix Underwood under his protection, and show him his curiosities. The
      boy&rsquo;s eyes grew round, and he exclaimed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Foolish guillemots&rsquo; eggs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is in the egg stage,&rdquo; said his father, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t answer for guillemots,&rdquo; said the General, &ldquo;but nothing seems to
      come amiss to Fergus, though his chief turn is for stones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a connection between the families, Bernard Underwood, the
      youngest brother of Lance, having married the elder sister of the
      aforesaid Fergus Merrifield. Miss Mohun, the sister who made a home for
      the General, had looked out the house that Lance had come to inspect. As
      it was nearly half-past twelve o&rsquo;clock, the party went round by the
      school, where, in the rear of the other rushing boys, came Fergus, in all
      the dignity of the senior form.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at him,&rdquo; said the General, &ldquo;those are honours one only gets once or
      twice in one&rsquo;s life, before beginning at the bottom again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fergus graciously received the introduction; and the next sound that was
      heard was, &ldquo;Have you any good fossils about you?&rdquo; in a tone as if he
      doubted whether so small a boy knew what a fossil meant; but little Felix
      was equal to the occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I once found a shepherd&rsquo;s crown, and father said it was a fossil
      sea-urchin, and that they are alive sometimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Echini. Oh yes&mdash;recent, you mean. There are lots of them here. I
      don&rsquo;t go in for those mere recent things,&rdquo; said Fergus, in a pre-Adamite
      tone, &ldquo;but my sister does. I can take you down to a fisherman who has
      always got some.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, may I? I&rsquo;ve got my eighteenpence,&rdquo; asked the boy, turning up his
      animated face, while Fergus, with an air of patronage, vouched for the
      honesty of Jacob Green, and undertook to bring his charge back in time for
      luncheon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lancelot Underwood had entirely got over that sense of being in a false
      position which had once rendered society distasteful to him. Many more men
      of family were in the like position with himself than had been the case
      when his brother had begun life; moreover, he had personally achieved some
      standing and distinction through the &lsquo;Pursuivant&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Mohun was delighted with his companion, whom he presented to his
      sister as the speedy consequence of her recommendation. She was rather
      surprised at the choice of an emissary, but her heart was won when she
      found Mr. Underwood as deep in the voluntary school struggle as she could
      be. Her brother held up his hands, and warned her that it was quite enough
      to be in the fray without going over it again, and that the breath of
      parish troubles would frighten away the invalid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll promise not to molest him,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; said Lance, &ldquo;one can look at other people&rsquo;s parishes more
      philosophically than at one&rsquo;s own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had begun to grow a little anxious about his boy, but presently from
      the garden, up from the cliff-path, the two bounded in&mdash;little Felix
      with the brightest of eyes and rosiest of cheeks, and a great ruddy,
      white-beaded sea-urchin held in triumph in his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, please,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;my hands are too dirty to shake; we&rsquo;ve been
      digging in the sand. It&rsquo;s too splendid! And they ought to have spines.
      When they are alive they walk on them. There&rsquo;s a bay! Oh, do come down and
      look for them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And pray what would become of Aunt Cherry&rsquo;s house, sir? Miss Mohun, may I
      take him to make his paws presentable?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A jolly little kid,&rdquo; pronounced Fergus, lingering before performing the
      same operation, &ldquo;but he has not got his mind opened to stratification, and
      only cares for recent rubbish. I wish it was a half-holiday, I would show
      him something!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General, who had a great turn for children, and for the chase in any
      form, was sufficiently pleased with little Felix&rsquo;s good manners and bright
      intelligence about bird, beast, and fish, as to volunteer to conduct him
      to the region most favourable to spouting razor-fish and ambulatory
      sea-urchins. The boy turned crimson and gasped&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, thank you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you indeed,&rdquo; said his father, when he had been carried off to
      inspect Fergus&rsquo;s museum in the lumber-room. &ldquo;&lsquo;To see a real General out of
      the wars&rsquo; was one great delight in coming here, though I believe he would
      have been no more surprised to hear that you had been at Agincourt than in
      Afghanistan. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s in history,&rsquo; he said with an awe-stricken voice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Fergus, after some shouting, was torn from his beloved museum, Felix
      came down in suppressed ecstasy, declaring it the loveliest and most
      delicious of places, all bones and stones, where his father must come and
      see what Fergus thought was a megatherium&rsquo;s tooth. The long word was
      pronounced with a triumphant delicacy of utterance, amid dancing bounds of
      the dainty, tightly-hosed little legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General and his companion went their way, while the other two had a
      more weary search, resulting in the choice of not the most inviting of the
      houses, but the one soonest available within convenient distance of church
      and sea. When it came to practical details, Miss Mohun was struck by the
      contrast between her companion&rsquo;s business promptness and the rapt, musing
      look she had seen when she came on him listening to the measured cadence
      of the waves upon the cliffs, and the reverberations in the hollows
      beneath. And when he went to hire a piano she, albeit unmusical, was
      struck by what her ears told her, yet far more by the look of reverent
      admiration and wonder that his touch and his technical remarks brought out
      on the dealer&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has that man, a bookseller and journalist, missed his vocation?&rdquo; she said
      to herself. &ldquo;Yet he looks too strong and happy for that. Has he conquered
      something, and been the better for it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made so many inquiries about Fergus and his school, that she began to
      think it must be with a view to his own pretty boy, who came back all
      sea-water and ecstasy, with a store of limpets, sea-weeds, scales, purses,
      and cuttle-fish&rsquo;s backbones for the delectation of his sisters. Above all,
      he was eloquent on the shell of a lacemaker crab, all over prickles, which
      he had seen hanging in the window of a little tobacconist. He had been so
      much fascinated by it that General Mohun regretted not having taken him to
      buy it, though it appeared to be displayed more for ornament than for
      sale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a disgusting den,&rdquo; added the General, &ldquo;with &lsquo;Ici on parle Francais&rsquo; 
      in the window, and people hanging about among whom I did not fancy taking
      the boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know the place,&rdquo; said Miss Mohun. &ldquo;Strange to say, it produces rather a
      nice girl, under the compulsion of the school officer. She is plainly half
      a foreigner, and when Mr. Flight got up those theatricals last winter she
      sung most sweetly, and showed such talent that I thought it quite
      dangerous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; said her brother. &ldquo;She was a fairy among the clods.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, to the amazement of Miss Mohun, who thought herself one
      of the earliest of risers, she not only met the father and son at early
      matins, but found that they had been out for two hours enjoying sea-side
      felicity, watching the boats come in, and delighting in the beauty of the
      fresh mackerel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they had not all been dead!&rdquo; sighed the tender-hearted little fellow.
      &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve got my lacemaker for Audrey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The carapace of a pagurus,&rsquo; as Fergus translated it.&rdquo; Adding, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      know the species.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can find out when father has time to let us look at the big natural
      history book in the shop,&rdquo; said Felix. &ldquo;We must not look at it unless he
      turns it over, so Pearl and I are saving up to buy it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For instance!&rdquo; said his father, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I could not help getting something for them all,&rdquo; pleaded the boy,
      &ldquo;and pagurus was not dear. At least he is, in the other way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care, Fely&mdash;he won&rsquo;t stand caresses. I should think he was the
      first crab ever so embraced.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder you got entrance so early in the day,&rdquo; said Miss Mohun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The girl was sweeping out the shop, and singing the morning hymn, so
      sweetly and truly, that it would have attracted me anyway,&rdquo; said Lancelot.
      &ldquo;No doubt the seafaring men want &lsquo;baccy at all hours. She was much amazed
      at our request, and called her mother, who came out in remarkable
      dishabille, and is plainly foreign. I can&rsquo;t think where I have seen such a
      pair of eyes&mdash;most likely in the head of some chorus-singer, indeed
      the voice had something of the quality. Anyway, she stared at me to the
      full extent of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Lancelot departed, having put in hand negotiations for a tolerable
      house not far from St. Andrew&rsquo;s Church, and studied the accommodation
      available for horses, and the powers of the pianos on hire.

      CHAPTER VI. &mdash; ST. ANDREW&rsquo;S ROCK
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Helpmates and hearthmates, gladdeners of gone years,
       Tender companions of our serious days,
     Who colour with your kisses, smiles, and tears,
       Life&rsquo;s worn web woven over wonted ways.&mdash;LYTTON.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How does he seem now?&rdquo; said Geraldine, as Lancelot came into the
      drawing-room of St. Andrew&rsquo;s Rock at Rockquay, in the full glare of a cold
      east windy May evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty well fagged out, but that does not greatly matter. I say, Cherry,
      how will you stand this? Till I saw you in this den, I had no notion how
      shabby, and dull, and ugly it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Lance, if you did but know how refreshing it is to see anything
      shabby, and dull, and ugly,&rdquo; Mrs. Grinstead answered with imitative
      inflections, which set Anna Vanderkist off into a fit of laughter,
      infecting both her uncle and aunt. The former gravely said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you had only mentioned it in time, I could have gratified you more
      effectually.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it is Aunt Cherry&rsquo;s charity,&rdquo; said Anna, recovering. &ldquo;The
      reflection that but for her the poor natives would never have been able to
      go to their German baths.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no such philanthropy, my dear. It is homeliness, or rather homeyness,
      that is dear to my bourgeoise mind. I was afraid of spick-and-span,
      sap-green aestheticism, but those curtains have done their own fading in
      pleasing shades, that good old sofa can be lain upon, and there&rsquo;s a real
      comfortable crack on that frame; while as to the chiffonier, is not it the
      marrow of the one Mrs. Froggatt left us, where Wilmet kept all the things
      in want of mending?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! didn&rsquo;t you shudder when she turned the key?&rdquo; said Lance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not knowing what was good for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you will send for some of our things and make it nice,&rdquo; entreated
      Anna, &ldquo;or Gerald will never stay here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never fear; we&rsquo;ll have it presentable by the vacation. As for Uncle
      Clement, he would never see whether he was in a hermit&rsquo;s cell, if he only
      had one arm-chair and one print from Raffaelle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a certain arch ring in her voice that had long been absent, and
      Anna looked joyous as she waited on them both.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad you brought her,&rdquo; said Lance, as she set off with Uncle
      Clement&rsquo;s tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she would not hear of the charms of the season.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the better for her. She is a good girl, and will be all the
      happier down here, as well as better. There&rsquo;s a whole hive of Merrifields
      to make merry with her; and, by the bye, Cherry, what should you think of
      housing a little chap for the school here where Fergus Merrifield is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your dear little Felix? Delightful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Ouf</i>! No, he is booked for our grammar school.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The grammar school was not good for any of you, except the one whom
      nothing hurt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very different now. I have full confidence in the head, and the
      tone is improved throughout. Till my boys are ready for a public school I
      had rather they were among our own people. No, Cherry, I can&rsquo;t do it, I
      can&rsquo;t give up the delight of him yet; no, I can&rsquo;t, nor lose his little
      voice out of the choir, and have his music spoilt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I spoil him. I really have flogged him once,&rdquo; said Lance,
      half wistfully, half playfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How proud you are of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was for maltreating little Joan Vanderkist, though if it had only been
      her brother, I should have said, &lsquo;Go it, boys.&rsquo; It was not till afterwards
      that it turned out that Joan was too loyal not to bear the penalty of
      having tied our little Audrey into a chair to be pelted with
      horse-chestnuts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At Adrian&rsquo;s bidding?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. I fancy the Harewood boys set him on. And what I thought of
      was sending Adrian here to be schooled at Mrs. Edgar&rsquo;s, boarded by you,
      mothered by Anna, and altogether saved from being made utterly detestable,
      as he will inevitably be if he remains to tyrannize over Vale Leston.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would his mother consent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know he is entirely in Clement&rsquo;s power.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would only be another worry for Clement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He need not have much of him, and I believe he would prefer to have him
      under his own eye; and Anna will think it bliss to have him, though what
      it may prove is another question. She will keep you from being too much
      bothered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Lance, will you never understand, that as furze and thistles are
      to a donkey, so are shabbiness and bother to me&mdash;a native element?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the morning Clement, raised on his pillows in bed, showed himself
      highly grateful for the proposal about his youngest ward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very good of you, Cherry,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That poor boy has been very
      much on my mind. This is the way to profit by my enforced leisure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way to make me dread him. You were to lie fallow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not exactly. I have thirteen or fourteen years&rsquo; reading and thinking to
      make up. I have done no more than get up a thing cursorily since I left
      Vale Leston.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are welcome to read and think, provided it is nothing more recent
      than St. Chrysostom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So here is the letter to Alda,&rdquo; giving it to her open.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Short and to the purpose,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alda submits to the inevitable,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t appear as if she had a
      choice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only mention the alleviations. No, you are not to get up yet. There&rsquo;s no
      place for you to sit in, and the east wind is not greatly mitigated by the
      sea air. Shall I send Anna to read to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In half-an-hour, if she is ready then; meantime, those two books, if you
      please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She handed him his Greek Testament and Bishop Andrews, and repaired to the
      drawing-room, where she found Anna exulting in the decorations brought
      from home, and the flowers brought in from an itinerant barrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been setting down what they must send us from home&mdash;your own
      chair and table, and the Liberty rugs, and the casts of St. Cecilia and
      little St. Cyrillus for those bare corners, and I am going out for a
      terra-cotta vase.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my dear, the room is charming; but don&rsquo;t let us get too dependent on
      pretty things. They demoralize as much or more than ugly ones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean that they are a luxury? Is it not right to try to have
      everything beautiful?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; exclaimed Anna.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my dear, I really get confused sometimes as to what is mere lust of
      the eye, and what is regard to whatever things are lovely. I believe the
      principle is really in each case to try whether the high object or the
      gratification of the senses should stand first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Anna, laughing, &ldquo;I suppose it is a high object not to
      alienate Gerald, as would certainly be done by the culture of the ugly&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or rather of that which pretends to be the reverse, and is only fashion,&rdquo;
       said her aunt, who meantime was moving about, adding nameless grace by her
      touch to all Anna&rsquo;s arrangements.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I send for the things then?&rdquo; said Anna demurely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, certainly; and you had better get the study arm-chair for your
      uncle. There is nothing so comfortable here. But I have news for you. What
      do you say to having little Adrian here, to go to school with the
      Merrifield boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What fun! what fun! How delicious!&rdquo; cried the sister, springing about
      like a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suspected that the person to whom he would give most trouble would feel
      it most pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what a funny, delightful child he is! You didn&rsquo;t see him
      driving all the little girls in a team four-in-hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It would be much to say that Mrs. Grinstead was enchanted by this proof of
      his charms; but they were interrupted by Marshall, the polite, patronizing
      butler, bringing in a card. Miss Mohun would be glad to know how Mr.
      Underwood was, and whether there was anything that she could do for Mrs.
      Grinstead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course she was asked to come in, and thus they met, the quick, slim,
      active little spinster, whose whole life had been work, and the far
      younger widow, whose vocation had been chiefly home-making. Their first
      silent impressions were&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope she is not going to be pathetic,&rdquo; and&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is enough to take one&rsquo;s breath away. But I think she has tact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a few exchanges of inquiry and answer, Miss Mohun said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My niece Gillian is burning to see you, after all your kindness to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be very glad. This is not quite a land of strangers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told her I was sure you would not want her to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. My brother is hardly up to afternoon visitors yet, and we have
      not been able to arrange his refuge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have transformed this room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or Anna has.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On which Miss Mohun begged for Miss Vanderkist to meet her nieces by and
      by at tea. Gillian would call for her at four o&rsquo;clock, and show her the
      way that it was hoped might soon be quite natural to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gillian&rsquo;s &lsquo;Aunt Jane,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Anna, when the visitor had tripped out. &ldquo;I
      never quite understood her way of talking of her. I think she worried
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your pronouns are confused, Annie. Which worried which? Or was it
      mutual?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the whole,&rdquo; laughed Anna back, &ldquo;I prefer an aunt to be waited on to
      one who pokes me up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt Log to Aunt Stork? To be poked will be wholesome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In due time there was a ring at the front door; Gillian Merrifield was
      indulged with a kiss and smile from the heroine of her worship, and Anna
      found herself in the midst of a garland of bright girls. She was a
      contrast to them, with her fair Underwood complexion, her short plump
      Vanderkist figure, and the mourning she still wore for the fatherly Uncle
      Grinstead; while the Merrifield party were all in different shades of the
      brunette, and wore bright spring raiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had only just come down the steps when they were greeted by a young
      clergyman, who said he was on his way to inquire for Mr. Underwood, and as
      he looked as if he expected a reply from Miss Vanderkist, she said her
      uncle was better, and would be glad to see Mr. Brownlow when he had rested
      after his journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope he will not bother him,&rdquo; she added; &ldquo;I know who he is now. He was
      at Whittingtonia for a little while, but broke down. There&rsquo;s no
      remembering all the curates there. My aunt likes his mother. Does he
      belong to this St. Andrew&rsquo;s Church?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, to the old one. You begin to see the tower.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that where you go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the old one in the morning, but we have a dear little old chapel at
      Clipstone, where Mr. Brownlow comes for the afternoon. It is all a good
      deal mixed up together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then another voice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think Mr. Underwood would preach to us? Mr. Brownlow says he never
      heard any one like him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anna stood still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody is to dare to mention preaching to Uncle Clement for the next six
      months, or they will deserve never to hear another sermon in their lives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an awful penalty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For shame, Dolores! Now,&rdquo; as the short remainder of a steep street was
      surmounted, &ldquo;here, as you may see, is the great hotel, and next beyond is
      Aunt Jane&rsquo;s, Beechcroft. On beyond, where you see that queer tower, is
      Cliff House, Mr. White&rsquo;s, who married our Aunt Adeline, only they are in
      Italy; and then comes Carrara, Captain Henderson&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are expected to rave about Mrs. Henderson&rsquo;s beauty,&rdquo; said the cousin,
      Dolores Mohun, as she opened Miss Mohun&rsquo;s gate, between two copper
      beeches, while Anna listened to the merry tongues, almost bewildered by
      the chatter, so unlike the seclusion and silent watching of the last
      month; but when Mysie Merrifield asked, &ldquo;Is it not quite overwhelming?&rdquo;
       she said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no! it is like being among them all at Vale Leston. My sisters always
      tell me my tongue wants greasing when I come down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her tongue was to have exercise enough among the bevy of damsels who
      surrounded her in Miss Mohun&rsquo;s drawing-room&mdash;four Merrifields,
      ranging from twenty-two to twelve years old, and one cousin, Dolores
      Mohun, with a father in New Zealand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you be in the Mouse-trap?&rdquo; presently asked number three, by name
      Valetta.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I did not know that she would drag it in!&rdquo; cried Dolores.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What may it be?&rdquo; asked Anna.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An essay society and not an essay society,&rdquo; was the lucid answer.
      &ldquo;Gillian said you would be sure to belong to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid I can&rsquo;t if it takes much time,&rdquo; said Anna in a pleading tone.
      &ldquo;My uncle is very far from well, and I have a good deal to do in the way
      of reading to him, and my little brother is coming to go to school with
      yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Underwood brought his little boy,&rdquo; said Gillian. &ldquo;Fergus said he was
      one of the jolliest little chaps he had ever seen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Reginald quite lost his heart to him,&rdquo; said Mysie, &ldquo;and Aunt Jane
      says he is a charming little fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Felix Underwood!&rdquo; said Anna. &ldquo;Adrian is much more manly. You should
      see him ride and climb trees.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The comparative value of brothers and cousins was very apparent. However,
      it was fixed that Anna should attend the Mouse-trap, and hear and
      contribute as she could find time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did the Erl King,&rdquo; said Valetta.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;&lsquo;Who rideth so late in the forest so wild?
            It is the fond father and his loving child.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, spare us, Val,&rdquo; cried her sister Gillian. &ldquo;Every one has done that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gerald parodied mine,&rdquo; said Anna.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;&lsquo;Who trampeth so late in a shocking bad hat?
           &lsquo;Tis the tipsy old father a-hugging his brat.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t recollect any more, but the Erl King&rsquo;s daughter is a
      beggar-woman, and it ends with&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give thee a tanner and make him a bait,
           So in the gin palace was settled his fate.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Some of the party were scandalized, others laughed as much or more than
      the effusion deserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We accept drawings,&rdquo; added another voice, &ldquo;and if any one does anything
      extraordinarily good in that way, or in writing, it makes a little book.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have higher designs than that,&rdquo; said Gillian. &ldquo;We want to print the
      cream.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the benefit of the school board&mdash;no, the board school.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! oh! Valetta!&rdquo; cried the general voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The thing is,&rdquo; explained Gillian, &ldquo;that we must build a new school for
      the out-liers of St. Kenelm&rsquo;s, or &lsquo;my lords&rsquo; will be down on us, and we
      shall be swamped by board schools.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt Jane is frantic about it,&rdquo; said Dolores Mohun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no escape from school board worries!&rdquo; exclaimed Anna. &ldquo;They
      helped to demolish Uncle Clement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is to be a sale of work, and a concert, and all sorts of jolly
      larks,&rdquo; added Valetta.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Larks! Oh, Val!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Larks aren&rsquo;t slang. They are in the dictionary,&rdquo; declared Valetta.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the bye, she has not heard the rules of the Mice,&rdquo; put in Mysie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say them,&rdquo; volunteered Valetta the irrepressible. &ldquo;Members of the
      Mouse-trap never utter slang expressions, never wear live birds&mdash;I
      mean dead ones&mdash;in their hats.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is an ostrich feather a live bird or a dead?&rdquo; demanded Anna.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And,&rdquo; said Dolores, &ldquo;what of the feather screens that the old Miss Smiths
      have been making all the winter-circles of pheasants&rsquo; feathers and
      peacocks&rsquo; eyes outside a border of drakes&rsquo; curls?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, like ostriches they don&rsquo;t count, since peacocks don&rsquo;t die, and drakes
      and pheasants <i>must</i>,&rdquo; said Gillian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have been getting ready for this sale ever so long,&rdquo; said Mysie. &ldquo;Aunt
      Jane has a working party every Friday for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fit day,&rdquo; said Dolores, &ldquo;for she is a perfect victim to other
      people&rsquo;s bad work, and spends the evening in stitching up and making
      presentable the wretched garments they turn out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The next rule&mdash;&rdquo; began Valetta, but Gillian mercilessly cut her
      short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know clever people, Anna. Do you know how to manage about our
      Mouse-trap book? Our bookseller here is a school-board man, all on the
      wrong side, and when I tried to feel our way, he made out that the
      printing and getting it up would cost a great deal more than we could
      risk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a pity that Uncle Lance is gone home,&rdquo; said Anna. &ldquo;He could tell
      you all about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could you not write to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, but I know he will want to see a specimen before he can make any
      estimate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was agreed that the specimen should be forthcoming on the next
      occasion, and Miss Mohun coming home, and tea coming in, the conference
      was ended. Anna began to unravel the relationships.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dolores Mohun was a niece of Lady Merrifield. She had lost her own mother
      early, and after living with the Merrifields for a year, had been taken by
      her father to New Zealand, where he had an appointment. He was a man of
      science, and she had been with him at Rotaruna during the terrible
      volcanic eruption, when there had been danger and terror enough to bring
      out her real character, and at the same time to cause an amount of
      intimacy with a young lady visitor little older than herself, which had
      suddenly developed into a second marriage of her father. In this state of
      things she had gladly availed herself of the home offered her at
      Clipstone, and had gone home under the escort of her Aunt Phyllis (Mrs.
      Harry May), who was going with her husband to spend a year in England.
      Dolores had greatly improved in all ways during her two years&rsquo; absence,
      and had become an affectionate, companionable, and thoughtful member of
      the Merrifield household, though still taking a line of her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Kalliope whom Gillian had befriended, to her own detriment, was now
      the very beautiful Mrs. Henderson, wife to the managing partner in the
      marble works. She continued to take a great interest in the young women
      employed in designing and mosaics, and had a class of them for reading and
      working. Dolores had been asked to tell first Aunt Jane&rsquo;s G. F. S. (Girl&rsquo;s
      Friendly Society) girls, and afterwards Mrs. Henderson&rsquo;s, about her New
      Zealand experiences and the earthquake, and this developed into regular
      weekly lectures on volcanoes and on colonies. She did these so well, that
      she was begged to repeat them for the girls at the High School, and she
      had begun to get them up very carefully, studying the best scientific
      books she could get, and thinking she saw her vocation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Henderson was quite a power in the place. Her brother Alexis was an
      undergraduate, but had been promised a tutorship for the vacation. He
      seldom appeared at Carrara, shrinking from what recalled the pain and
      shame that he had suffered; while Petros worked under Captain Henderson,
      and Theodore was still in the choir at St. Matthew&rsquo;s. Maura had become the
      darling of Mr. White, and was much beloved by Mrs. White, though there had
      been a little alarm the previous year, when Lord Rotherwood and his son
      came down to open a public park or garden on the top of the cliffs, where
      Lord Rotherwood&rsquo;s accident had occurred. Lord Ivinghoe, a young Guardsman,
      had shown himself enough disposed to flirt with the pretty little Greek to
      make the prudent very glad that her home was on the Italian mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gillian was always Mrs. Henderson&rsquo;s friend, but Gillian&rsquo;s mind was full of
      other things. For her father had reluctantly promised, that if one of her
      little brothers got a scholarship at one of the public schools, Gillian
      might fulfil her ardent desire of going to a ladies&rsquo; college. Wilfred was
      a hopeless subject. It might be doubted if he could have succeeded. He had
      apparently less brain power than some of the family, and he certainly
      would not exert what he had. His mother had dragged him through holiday
      tasks; but nobody else could attempt to make him work when at home, and
      Gillian&rsquo;s offers had been received with mockery or violence. So all her
      hopes centred on Fergus, who, thanks to Aunt Jane&rsquo;s evening influence over
      his lessons, stood foremost in Mrs. Edgar&rsquo;s school, and was to go up to
      try for election at Winchester College at the end of the term. Were
      Gillian&rsquo;s hopes to be ruined by his devotion to the underground world?

      CHAPTER VII. &mdash; THE HOPE OF VANDERKIST
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     A breath of air,
     A bullock&rsquo;s low,
     A bunch of flowers,
     Hath power to call from everywhere
     The spirit of forgotten hours&mdash;
     Hours when the heart was fresh and young,
     When every string in freedom sung,
     Ere life had shed one leaf of green.
                              JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL.
</pre>
    <p>
      There had been some curiosity as to who would be thought worthy to bring
      the precious little baronet to Rockquay, and there was some diversion, as
      well as joy, when it proved that no one was to be entrusted with him but
      his eldest aunt, Mrs. Harewood, who was to bring him in Whitsun week, so
      that he might begin with a half-term.
    </p>
    <p>
      The arrival was a pretty sight, as the aunt rejoiced at seeing both her
      hosts at the front door to greet her, and as Anna held out her glad arms
      to the little brother who was the pride of the family.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, Adrian, boy!&rdquo; said the Vicar, only greeting with the hand, at sight
      of the impatient wriggle out of the embrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an open, sunburnt, ruddy face, and wide, fearless grey eyes that
      looked up to him, the bullet head in stiff, curly flaxen hair held aloft
      with an air of &ldquo;I am monarch of all I survey,&rdquo; and there was a tone of
      equality in the &ldquo;Holloa, Uncle Clement,&rdquo; to the tall clergyman who towered
      so far above the sturdy little figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently on the family inquiries there broke&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, Annie, where&rsquo;s the school?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the foot of this hill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to see it&rdquo; (imperiously).
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have some tea first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you are glad to come, Adrian?&rdquo; said Mrs. Grinstead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Aunt Cherry. It is high time I was away from such a lot of
      women-folk,&rdquo; he replied, with his hands in his pockets, and his legs set
      like a little colossus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anna had no peace till, after the boy had swallowed a tolerable amount of
      bread-and-butter and cake, she took him out, and then Mrs. Harewood had to
      explain his mother&rsquo;s urgent entreaties that the regime at Vale Leston
      should be followed up, and the boy see only such habits as would be those
      of total abstainers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor woman! as her brother and sisters knew, there was reason to believe
      that the vice which had been fatal to her happiness and her husband&rsquo;s
      life, had descended to him from Dutch forefathers, and there was the less
      cause for wonder at the passionate desire to guard her son from it. Almost
      all her family had been water-drinkers from infancy, and though Major
      Harewood called teetotalism a superstitious contempt of Heaven&rsquo;s good
      gifts, and disapproved of supplementing the baptismal vow, his brother the
      Rector had found it expedient, for the sake of the parish, to embrace
      formally the temperance movement, and thus there had been little
      difficulty in giving way to Alda&rsquo;s desire that, at the luncheon-table,
      Adrian should never see wine or beer, and she insisted that the same rule
      should prevail at Rockquay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clement had taken the pledge when a lad of sixteen, and there were those
      who thought that, save for his persistence under warnings of failing
      strength, much of his present illness might have been averted, with all
      the consequent treatment. He believed in total abstinence as safer for his
      ward, but he thought that the time had come for training, in seeing
      without partaking. Wilmet agreed, and said she had tried to persuade her
      sister; but she had only caused an hysterical agitation, so that weakness
      as usual gained the victory, and she had all but promised to bring the boy
      home again unless she could exact an engagement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To follow the Vale Leston practice at his early dinner,&rdquo; said Geraldine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may be,&rdquo; said Clement; &ldquo;but I do not engage not to have the matter
      out with him if I see that it is expedient.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am only doubtful how Gerald will take it,&rdquo; said his sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gerald has always been used to it at Vale Leston,&rdquo; said Wilmet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, but there he is your guest. Here he will regard himself as at home.
      However, he is a good boy, and will only grumble a little for appearance
      sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should hope so,&rdquo; said Wilmet severely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is the Penbeacon affair going on?&rdquo; asked Clement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Clem, I did not think you had heard of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had a letter in the middle of the mission, but I could not answer it
      then, and it seems to have been lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Geraldine pronounced it the straw that broke the camel&rsquo;s back, when she
      heard of the company that only waited to dig china clay out of Penbeacon
      and wash it in the Ewe till they could purchase a slice of the hill
      pertaining to the Vale Leston estate. Major Harewood had replied that his
      fellow-trustee was too ill to attend to business, and that the matter had
      better be let alone till the heir attained his majority.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shelved for the present,&rdquo; said Mrs. Grinstead. &ldquo;Fancy Ewe and Leston
      contaminated!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John talks to the young engineer, Mr. Bramshaw, and thinks that may be
      prevented; but that is not the worst,&rdquo; said Wilmet; &ldquo;it would change the
      whole face of the parish, and bring an influx of new people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Break up Penbeacon and cover it with horrible little new houses. Men like
      Walsh never see a beautiful place but they begin to think how to destroy
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Cherry, you have the most influence with Gerald, but he talks to
      the girls of our having no right to keep the treasures of the hills for
      our exclusive pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not exclusive. Half the country disports itself there. It is the
      great place for excursions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he declares that it is a grave matter to hinder an industry that
      would put bread into so many mouths, and that fresh outlets would be good
      for the place; something too about being an obstruction, and the rights of
      labour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know what that means. It is only teasing the cousinhood when they
      fall on him open-mouthed,&rdquo; said Geraldine, with a laugh, though with a
      qualm of misgiving at her heart, while Clement sat listening and thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Harewood farther explained, that she hoped either that Gerald would
      marry, or that her sister would make a home for him at the Priory. It then
      appeared that Major Harewood thought it would be wise to leave the young
      man to manage the property for himself without interference; and that the
      uncle to whom the Major had become heir was anxious to have the family at
      hand, even offering to arrange a house for Lady Vanderkist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A year of changes,&rdquo; sighed Geraldine; &ldquo;but this waiting time seems
      intended to let one gather one&rsquo;s breath.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Wilmet looked careworn, partly, no doubt, with the harass of continual
      attention to her sister Alda, who, though subdued and improved in many
      important ways, was unavoidably fretful from ill-health, and disposed to
      be very miserable over her straitened means, and the future lot of her
      eight daughters, especially as the two of the most favourable age seemed
      to resign their immediate chances of marrying. Moreover, though all began
      life as pretty little girls, they had a propensity to turn into Dutchwomen
      as they grew up, and Franceska, the fifth in age, was the only one who
      renewed the beauty of the twin sisters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alda was not, however, Wilmet&rsquo;s chief care, though of that she did not
      speak. She was not happy at heart about her two boys. Kester was a soldier
      in India, not actually unsteady, but not what her own brothers had been,
      and Edward was a midshipman, too much of the careless, wild sailor.
      Easy-going John Harewood&rsquo;s lax discipline had not been successful with
      them in early youth, and still less had later severity and indignation
      been effectual.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad you kept Anna,&rdquo; said Mrs. Harewood, &ldquo;though Alda is very much
      disappointed that she is not having a season in London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will not take it,&rdquo; said Geraldine. &ldquo;She insists that she prefers
      Uncle Clem to all the fine folk she might meet; and after all, poor
      Marilda&rsquo;s acquaintance are not exactly the upper ten thousand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Marilda! You know that she is greatly vexed that Emilia is bent on
      being a hospital nurse, or something like it, and only half yields to go
      out with her this summer in very unwilling obedience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know. She wants to come here, and I mean to have her before the
      long vacation for a little while. We heard various outpourings, and I
      cannot quite think Miss Emilia a grateful person, though I can believe
      that she does not find it lively at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She seems to be allowed plenty of slum work, as it is the fashion to call
      it, and no one can be more good and useful than Fernan and Marilda, so
      that I call it sheer discontent and ingratitude not to put up with them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only modernishness, my dear Wilmet. It is the spirit of the times, and
      the young things can&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem to suffer in that way&mdash;at least with Anna.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; Anna is a dear good girl, and Uncle Clem is her hero, but I am very
      glad she has nice young companions in the Merrifields, and an excitement
      in prospect in this bazaar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought a bazaar quite out of your line.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There seems to be no other chance of saving this place from board
      schools. Two thousand pounds have to be raised, and though Lord Rotherwood
      and Mr. White, the chief owners of property, have done, and will do, much,
      there still remains greater need than a fleeting population like this can
      be expected to supply, and Clement thinks that a bazaar is quite
      justifiable in such a case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there is nothing undesirable,&rdquo; said Mrs. Harewood, in her original
      &ldquo;what it may lead to&rdquo; voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trust Lady Merrifield and Jane Mohun for that! I am going to take you to
      call upon Lilias Merrifield.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yea; I shall wish to see the mother of Bernard&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clement, who went with them, explained to his somewhat wondering elder
      sister that he thought safeguards to Christian education so needful, that
      he was quite willing that, even in this brief stay, all the aid in their
      power should be given to the cause at Rockquay. Nay, as he afterwards
      added to Wilmet, he was very glad to see how much it interested Geraldine,
      and that the work for the Church and the congenial friends were rousing
      her from her listless state of dejection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Merrifield and Mrs. Harewood were mutually charmed, perhaps all the
      more because the former was not impassioned about the bazaar. She said she
      had been importuned on such subjects wherever she had gone, and had learnt
      to be passive; but her sister Jane was all eagerness, and her younger
      young people, as she called the present half of her family, were in the
      greatest excitement over their first experience of the kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well is it for all undertakings that there should always be somebody to
      whom all is new, and who can be zealous and full of delight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By no means surtout point de zele,&rdquo; returned Geraldine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As well say no fermentation,&rdquo; said Lady Merrifield.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A dangerous thing,&rdquo; said Clement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But sourness comes without it, or at least deadness,&rdquo; returned his
      sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wherewith they returned to talk of their common relations.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was like a joke to the brother and sisters, that their Bernard should
      be a responsible husband and father, whereas Lady Merrifield&rsquo;s notion of
      him was as a grave, grand-looking man with a splendid beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fergus Merrifield was asked to become the protector of Adrian, whereat he
      looked sheepish; but after the round of pets had been made he informed his
      two youngest sisters, Valetta and Primrose, that it was the cheekiest
      little fellow he had ever seen, who would never know if he was bullied
      within an inch of his life; not that he (Fergus) should let the fellows do
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      So though until Monday morning Anna was the slave of her brother, doing
      her best to supply the place of the six devoted sisters at home, the young
      gentleman ungratefully announced at breakfast&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want gy-arls after me,&rdquo; with a peculiarly contemptuous twirl at
      the beginning of the word; &ldquo;Merrifield is to call for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anna, who had brought down her hat, looked mortified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, Annie,&rdquo; said her uncle, &ldquo;he will know better one of these
      days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I shan&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Adrian, turning round defiantly. &ldquo;If she comes
      bothering after me at dinner-time I shall throw my books at her&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      all! There&rsquo;s Merrifield,&rdquo; and he banged out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; again said his uncle, &ldquo;he has had a large dose of the
      feminine element, and this is his swing out of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hopes, which Anna thought cruel, were entertained by her elders that the
      varlet would return somewhat crestfallen, but there were no such symptoms;
      the boy re-appeared in high spirits, having been placed well for his
      years, but not too well for popularity, and in the playground he had found
      himself in his natural element. The boys were mostly of his own size, or a
      little bigger, and bullying was not the fashion. He had heard enough
      school stories to be wary of boasting of his title, and as long as he did
      not flaunt it before their eyes, it was regarded as rather a credit to the
      school.
    </p>
    <p>
      Merrifield was elated at the success of his protege, and patronized him
      more than he knew, accepting his devotion in a droll, contemptuous manner,
      so that the pair were never willingly apart. As Fergus slept at his aunt&rsquo;s
      during the week, the long summer evenings afforded splendid opportunities
      for what Fergus called scientific researches in the quarries and cliffs.
      It was as well for Lady Vanderkist&rsquo;s peace of mind that she did not
      realize them, though Fergus was certified by his family to be cautious and
      experienced enough to be a safe guide. Perhaps people were less nervous
      about sixth sons than only ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was, indeed, a certain undeveloped idea held out that some of the
      duplicates of Fergus&rsquo;s precious collection might be arranged as a sample
      of the specimens of minerals and fossils of Rockquay at the long-talked-of
      sale of work.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII. &mdash; THE MOUSE-TRAP
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  If a talent be a claw, look how he claws him with a talent.
                                        Love&rsquo;s Labour&rsquo;s Lost.
</pre>
    <p>
      The young ladies were truly in an intense state of excitement about the
      sale of work, especially about the authorship; and Uncle Lancelot having
      promised to send an estimate, a meeting of the Mouse-trap was convened to
      consider of the materials, and certainly the mass of manuscript
      contributed at different times to the Mouse-trap magazine was appalling to
      all but Anna, who knew what was the shrinkage in the press.
    </p>
    <p>
      She, however, held herself bound not to inflict on her busy uncle the
      reading of anything entirely impracticable, so she sat with a stern and
      critical eye as the party mustered in Miss Mohun&rsquo;s drawing-room, and
      Gillian took the chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The great design,&rdquo; said she impressively, &ldquo;is that the Mouse-trap should
      collect and print and publish a selection for the benefit of the school.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Mice vehemently applauded, only Miss Norton, the oldest of the party,
      asked humbly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would any one think it worth buying?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; cried Valetta. &ldquo;Lots of translations!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Erl King, for instance,&rdquo; put in Dolores Mohun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Anna would append the parody,&rdquo; suggested Gillian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, parodies are&mdash;are horrid,&rdquo; said Mysie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Many people feel them so,&rdquo; said Gillian, &ldquo;but to others I think they are
      almost a proof of love, that they can make sport with what they admire so
      much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Mysie, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s Dolores&rsquo; Eruption!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a nice subject,&rdquo; laughed Gillian. &ldquo;However, it will do beautifully,
      being the description of the pink terraces of that place with the
      tremendous name in New Zealand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you there?&rdquo; cried Anna.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I always wonder how she can look the same after such adventures,&rdquo;
       said Mysie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know it is much the same as my father&rsquo;s paper in the Scientific
      World,&rdquo; said Dolores.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody over reads that, so it won&rsquo;t signify,&rdquo; was the uncomplimentary
      verdict.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And,&rdquo; added Mysie, &ldquo;Mr. Brownlow would do a history of Rockquay, and that
      would be worth having.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, the dear ghost and all!&rdquo; cried Valetta.
    </p>
    <p>
      The acclamation was general, for the Reverend Armine Brownlow was the
      cynosure curate of the lady Church-helpers, and Mysie produced as a
      precious loan, to show what could be done, the volume containing the
      choicest morceaux of the family magazine of his youth, the Traveller&rsquo;s
      Joy, in white parchment binding adorned with clematis, and emblazoned with
      the Evelyn arms on one side, the Brownlow on the other, and full of
      photographs and reproductions of drawings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much too costly,&rdquo; said the prudent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was not for sale,&rdquo; said Mysie, obviously uneasy while it was being
      handed round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Half-a-crown should be our outside price,&rdquo; said Gillian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or a shilling without photographs, half-a-crown with,&rdquo; was added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I ask Uncle Lance what can be done for how much?&rdquo; asked Anna, and
      this was accepted with acclamation, but, as Gillian observed, they had yet
      got no further than Dolores&rsquo; Eruption and the unwritten history.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are lots of stories,&rdquo; said Kitty Varley; &ldquo;the one about Bayard and
      all the knights in Italy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The one,&rdquo; said Gillian, &ldquo;where Padua got into the kingdom of Naples, and
      the lady of the house lighted a lucifer match, besides the horse who
      drained a goblet of red wine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know that was only the pronouns,&rdquo; suggested the author.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s another,&rdquo; added Valetta, &ldquo;called Monrepos&mdash;such a
      beauty, when the husband was wounded, and died at his wife&rsquo;s feet just as
      the sun gilded the tops of the pines, and she died when the moon set, and
      the little daughter went in and was found dead at their feet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, Val,&rdquo; said Gillian. &ldquo;Here is a story that Bessie has sent us&mdash;really
      worth having.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mesa! Oh, of course,&rdquo; was the acclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And here&rsquo;s a little thing of mine,&rdquo; Gillian added modestly, &ldquo;about the
      development of the brain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this there was a shout.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little thing! Isn&rsquo;t it on the differential calculus?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, I don&rsquo;t see why Rockquay should not have a little rational
      study!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! but the present question is what Rockquay will buy; to further future
      development it may be, but I am afraid their brains are not yet developed
      enough,&rdquo; said Emma Norton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well then, here is the comparison between Euripides and Shakespeare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you read papa and everybody to sleep with,&rdquo; said Valetta
      pertly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Except Aunt Lily, and she said she had read something very like it in
      Schlegel,&rdquo; added Dolores.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not be too deep for ordinary intellects, Gillian,&rdquo; said Emma
      Norton good-naturedly. &ldquo;Surely there is that pretty history you made out
      of Count Baldwin the Pretender.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That! Oh, that is a childish concern.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The better fitted for our understandings,&rdquo; said Emma, disinterring it,
      and handing it over to Anna, while Mysie breathed out&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I did like it! And, Gill, where is Phyllis&rsquo;s account of the Jubilee
      gaieties and procession last year?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would make the fortune of any paper,&rdquo; said Anna.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, if Lady Rotherwood will let it be used,&rdquo; said Gillian. &ldquo;It is really
      delightful and full of fun, but I am quite sure that her name could not
      appear, and I do not expect leave to use it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I write and ask?&rdquo; said Mysie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, do; if Cousin Rotherwood is always gracious, it is specially to
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wrote to my cousin, Gerald Underwood,&rdquo; said Anna, &ldquo;to ask if he had
      anything to spare us, though I knew he would laugh at the whole concern,
      and he has sent down this. I don&rsquo;t quite know whether he was in earnest or
      in mischief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she read aloud&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;Dreaming of her laurels green,
           The learned Girton girl is seen,
           Or under the trapeze neat
           Figuring as an athlete.

           Never at the kitchen door
           Will she scrub or polish more;
           No metaphoric dirt she eats,
           Literal dirt may form her treats.

           Mary never idle sits,
           Home lessons can&rsquo;t be learnt by fits;
           Hard she studies all the week,
           Answers with undaunted cheek.

           When to exam Mary goes,
           Smartly dressed in stunning clothes,
           Expert in algebraic rule,
           Best pupil-teacher of her school.

           Oh, how clever we are found
           Who live on England&rsquo;s happy ground,
           Where rich and poor and wretched may
           Be drilled in Whitehall&rsquo;s favoured way.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      There was a good deal of laughter at this parody of Jane Taylor&rsquo;s Village
      Girl, though Mysie was inclined to be shocked as at something profane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what will you think of this?&rdquo; said Anna, beginning gravely to read
      aloud The Inspector&rsquo;s Tour.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was very clever, so clever that Valetta and Kitty Varley both listened
      as in sober earnest, never discovering, or only in flashes like Mysie,
      that it was really a satire on all the social state of the different
      European nations, under the denomination of schools. One being depicted as
      highly orthodox, but much given to sentence insubordination to dark cold
      closets; another as given to severe drill, but neglecting manners; a third
      as repudiating religious teaching, and now and then preparing explosions
      for the masters&mdash;no, teachers. The various conversations were
      exceedingly bright and comical; and there were brilliant hits at existing
      circumstances, all a little in a socialistic spirit, which made Anna pause
      as she read. She really had not perceived till she heard it in her own
      voice and with other ears how audacious it was, especially for a school
      bazaar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dolores applauded with her whole heart, but owned that it might be too
      good for the Mouse-trap, it would be too like catching a monkey! Gillian,
      more doubtfully, questioned whether it would &ldquo;quite do&rdquo;; and Mysie, when
      she understood the allusions, thought it would not. Emma Norton was more
      decided, and it ended by deciding that the paper should be read to the
      elders at Clipstone, and their decision taken before sending it to Uncle
      Lance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spirits of the Muscipula party rose as they discussed the remaining
      MSS., but these were not of the highest order of merit; and Anna thought
      that the really good would be sufficient; and all the Underwood kith and
      kin had sufficient knowledge of the Press through their connection with
      the &lsquo;Pursuivant&rsquo; to be authorities on the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fergus has some splendid duplicate ammonites for me and bits of crystal,&rdquo;
       said Mysie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, do let Fergus alone,&rdquo; entreated Gillian. &ldquo;He is almost a petrifaction
      already, and you know what depends on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My sister is coming next week for a few days,&rdquo; said Anna. &ldquo;She is very
      clever, and may help us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emilia was accordingly introduced to the Mice, but she was not very
      tolerant of them. Essay societies, she said, were out of date, and she
      thought the Rockquay young ladies a very country-town set.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know them, Emmie,&rdquo; said Anna. &ldquo;Gillian and Dolores are very
      remarkable girls, only&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only they are kept down by their mothers, I suppose. Is that the reason
      they don&rsquo;t do anything but potter after essay societies and Sunday-schools
      like our little girls at Vale Leston? Why, I asked Gillian, as you call
      her, what they were doing about the Penitents&rsquo; Home, and she said her
      mother and Aunt Jane went to look after it, but never talked about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know they are all very young.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young indeed! How is one ever to be of any use if mothers and people are
      always fussing about one&rsquo;s being young?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One won&rsquo;t always be so&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They would think so, like the woman of a hundred years old, who said on
      her daughter&rsquo;s death at eighty, &lsquo;Ah, poor girl, I knew I never should rear
      her!&rsquo; How shall I get to see the Infirmary here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Mohun would take you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I go without a fidgety old maid after me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I wish you would do, Emmie. Write an account of one of
      your hospital visits, or of the match-girls, for the Mouse-trap. Do! You
      know Gerald has written something for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He! Why he has too much sense to write for your voluntary schools. Or it
      would be too clever and incisive for you. Ah! I see it was so by your
      face! What did he send you? Have you got it still?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have really a parody of his which is going in&mdash;The Girton Girl.
      Now, Emmie, won&rsquo;t you? You have told me such funny things about your
      match-girls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not mean to let them be turned into ridicule by your prim, decorous
      swells. Why, I unfortunately told Fernan Brown one story&mdash;about their
      mocking old Miss Bruce with putting on imitation spectacles&mdash;and it
      has served him for a cheval de bataille ever since! Oh, my dear Anna, he
      gets more hateful than ever. I wish you would come back and divert his
      attention.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think we could change? You could go and let Marilda fuss with
      you, now that Uncle Clem and Aunt Cherry are so well, and I could look
      after Adrian, and go to the Infirmary, and the penitents, and all that
      these people neglect; maybe I would write for the Mouse-trap, if Gerald
      does when he comes home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anna did not like the proposal, but she pitied Emilia, and cared for her
      enough to carry the scheme to her aunt. But Geraldine shook her head. The
      one thing she did not wish was to have Emmie riding, walking, singing, and
      expanding into philanthropy with Gerald, and besides, she knew that Emilia
      would never have patience to read to her uncle, or help Adrian in his
      preparation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you really wish this, my dear?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;N&mdash;no, not at all; but Emmie does. Could you not try her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Annie dear, if you wish to have a fortnight or more in town&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no, no, auntie, indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We could get on now without you. Or we would keep Emmie till the room is
      wanted; but I had far rather be alone than have the responsibility of
      Emmie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, indeed; I don&rsquo;t think Adrian would be good long with her. I had
      much rather stay&mdash;only Emmie did wish, and she hates the&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my dear, you need not tell me; I only know that I cannot have her
      after next week; the room will be wanted for Gerald.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She could sleep with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Annie, I must disappoint you. There is not room for her, and her
      flights when Gerald comes would never do for your uncle. You know it
      yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anna could not but own the wisdom of the decision, and Emmie, after
      grumbling at Aunt Cherry, took herself off. She had visited the Infirmary
      and the Convalescent Home, and even persuaded Mrs. Hablot to show her the
      Union Workhouse, but she never sent her contribution to the Mouse-trap.

     Do the work that&rsquo;s nearest,
     Though it&rsquo;s dull at whiles,
     Helping, when we meet them,
     Lame dogs over stiles.

     Marks of angels&rsquo; feet;
     Epics in each pebble

</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drawing? Well done, Cherie! That&rsquo;s a jolly little beggar; quite masterly,
      as old Renville would say,&rdquo; exclaimed Gerald Underwood, looking at a
      charming water-colour of a little fisher-boy, which Mrs. Grinstead was
      just completing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The Faithful Henchman,&rsquo; it ought to be called,&rdquo; said Anna. &ldquo;That little
      being has attached himself to Fergus Merrifield, and follows him and
      Adrian everywhere on what they are pleased to call their scientific
      expeditions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The science of larks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh dear, no. Fergus is wild after fossils, and has made Adrian the same,
      and he really knows an immense deal. They are always after fossils and
      stones when they are out of school.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The precious darling!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Mohun says Fergus is quite to be trusted not to take him into
      dangerous places.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An unlooked-for blessing. Ha!&rdquo; as he turned over his aunt&rsquo;s portfolio,
      &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a stunner! You should work it up for the Academy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This kind of thing is better for the purpose,&rdquo; Mrs. Grinstead said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Throw away such work upon a twopenny halfpenny bazaar! Heaven forefend!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be tiresome, Gerald,&rdquo; entreated Anna. &ldquo;You are going to do all
      sorts of things for it, and we shall have no end of fun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the sake of stopping the course of the current,&rdquo; returned Gerald,
      proceeding to demonstrate in true nineteenth-century style the
      hopelessness of subjecting education to what he was pleased to call
      clericalism. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never reach the masses while you insist on using an
      Apostle spoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Masses are made up of atoms,&rdquo; replied his aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we shall be lost if you don&rsquo;t help,&rdquo; added Anna.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would help readily enough if it were free dinners, or anything to
      equalize the existence of the classes, instead of feeding the artificial
      wants of the one at the expense of the toil and wretchedness of the
      other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He proceeded to mention some of the miseries that he had learnt through
      the Oxford House&mdash;dilating on them with much enthusiasm&mdash;till
      presently his uncle came in, and ere long a parlour-maid announced
      luncheon, just as there was a rush into the house. Adrian was caught by
      his sister, and submitted, without more than a &ldquo;Bother!&rdquo; to be made
      respectable, and only communicating in spasmodic gasps facts about
      Merrifield and hockey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Marshall?&rdquo; asked Gerald at the first opportunity, on the maid
      leaving the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marshall could not stand it,&rdquo; said his aunt. &ldquo;He can&rsquo;t exist without
      London, and doing the honours of a studio.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Left you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most politely he informed me that this place does not agree with his
      health; and there did not seem sufficient scope for his services since the
      Reverend Underwood had become so much more independent. So we were
      thankful to dispose of him to Lord de Vigny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was a great plague,&rdquo; interpolated Adrian, &ldquo;always jawing about the
      hall-door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you really without a man-servant?&rdquo; demanded Gerald.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the house. Lomax comes up from the stables to take some of the work.
      Some lemonade, Gerald?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gerald gazed round in search of unutterable requirements; but only met
      imploring eyes from aunt and sister, and restraining ones from his uncle.
      He subsided and submitted to the lemonade, while Anna diverted attention
      by recurring rather nervously to the former subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I have got rid of Porter, she kept me in far too good order.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As if Sibby did not,&rdquo; said Clement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, and you too! But that comes naturally, and began in babyhood!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you done with the house at Brompton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Martha is taking care of it&mdash;Mrs. Lightfoot, don&rsquo;t you know? One of
      our old interminable little Lightfoots, who went to be a printer in
      London, married, and lost his wife; then in our break-up actually married
      Martha to take care of his children! Now he is dead, and I am thankful to
      have her in the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To frighten loafers with her awful squint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forgive the rejection of &lsquo;The Inspector&rsquo;s Tour&rsquo;? Indeed I think you
      expected it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wanted to see whether the young ladies would find it out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No compliment to our genius,&rdquo; said his aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you, like Mrs. Bennet, &lsquo;there is plenty of that sort of thing,&rsquo;&rdquo;
       said Anna. &ldquo;Some of them were mystified, but Gillian and Dolores Mohun
      were in ecstasies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ecstasies from that cheerful name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is the New Zealand niece&mdash;Mr. Maurice Mohun&rsquo;s daughter. They
      carried it home to their seniors, and of course the verdict was &lsquo;too
      strong for Rockquay atmosphere,&rsquo;&rdquo; said his aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it did not even go to Uncle Lance,&rdquo; said Anna. &ldquo;Shall you try the
      &lsquo;Pursuivant&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, I shall put in the pepper and salt I regretted, and try
      the &lsquo;Censor&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo; observed his uncle, in a tone of surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Gerald coolly, &ldquo;I have sent little things to the &lsquo;Censor&rsquo; 
      before, which they seem to regard in the light of pickles and laver.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The &lsquo;Censor&rsquo; was an able paper on the side of philosophical politics, and
      success in that quarter was a feather in the young man&rsquo;s cap, though not
      quite the kind of feather his elders might have desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Journalism is a kind of native air to us,&rdquo; said Mrs. Grinstead, &ldquo;but from
      &lsquo;Pur.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Pur&rsquo; is the element of your dear old world, Cherie,&rdquo; said Gerald, &ldquo;and
      here am I come to do your bidding in its precincts, for a whole long
      vacation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke lightly, and with a pretty little graceful bow to his aunt, but
      there was something in his eyes and smile that conveyed to her a dread
      that he meant that he only resigned himself for the time and looked
      beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Lance is coming,&rdquo; volunteered Adrian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Geraldine. &ldquo;Chorister that he was, and champion of Church
      teaching that he is, he makes the cause of Christian education everywhere
      his own, and is coming down to see what he can do inexpensively with
      native talent for concert, or masque, or something&mdash;&lsquo;Robin Hood&rsquo; 
      perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ending in character with a rush on the audience?&rdquo; said Gerald. &ldquo;Otherwise
      &lsquo;Robin Hood&rsquo; is stale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tennyson has spoilt that for public use,&rdquo; said Mrs. Grinstead. &ldquo;But was
      not something else in hand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only rehearsed. It never came off,&rdquo; said Gerald.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The most awful rot,&rdquo; said Adrian. &ldquo;I would have nothing to do with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In consequence it was a failure,&rdquo; laughed Gerald.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was &lsquo;The Tempest&rsquo;, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said Anna.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not really!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Grinstead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About as like as a wren to an eagle,&rdquo; said Gerald.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We had it at the festival last winter. The authors adapted the plot, that
      was all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The authors being&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The present company,&rdquo; said Gerald, &ldquo;and Uncle Bill, with Uncle Lance
      supplying or adapting music, for we were not original, I assure you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was when Uncle Clem was ill,&rdquo; put in Anna, &ldquo;and somehow I don&rsquo;t think
      we took in the accounts of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Gerald, &ldquo;and nobody did it con amore, though we could not put
      it off. I should like to see it better done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such rot!&rdquo; exclaimed Adrian. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s an old man, he was Uncle Lance with
      the great white beard made out of Kit&rsquo;s white bear&rsquo;s skin, and he lived in
      a desert island, where there was a shipwreck&mdash;very jolly if you could
      see it, only you can&rsquo;t&mdash;and the savages&mdash;no, the wreckers all
      came down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, in a desert island?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was not exactly desert. Gerald, I say, do let there be savages. It
      would be such a lark to have them all black, and then I&rsquo;d act.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an inducement!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then somebody turned out to be somebody&rsquo;s enemy, and the old chap
      frightened them all with squibs and crackers and fog-horns, till somebody
      turned out to be somebody else&rsquo;s son, and married the daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you trace &lsquo;The Tempest&rsquo; through that version you are clever,&rdquo; said
      Gerald.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you it was awful rot,&rdquo; said Adrian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Merrifield! Excuse me, Cherie.&rdquo; And off he went.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sentiments of the actors somewhat resembled Adrian&rsquo;s. It was too new,
      and needed more learning and more pains, so they beg to revert to &lsquo;Robin
      Hood&rsquo;. However, I should like to see it well got up for once, if only by
      amateurs. Miranda has a capital song by Uncle Bill, made for Francie&rsquo;s
      soprano. She cuts you all out, Anna.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That she does, in looks and voice, but she could not act here in public.
      However, we will lay it before the Mouse-trap. Was it printed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lance had enough for the performers struck off. Francie could send some
      up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all,&rdquo; said Cherie, &ldquo;the desert island full of savages and wreckers
      is not more remarkable than the &lsquo;still-vex&rsquo;d Bermoothes&rsquo; getting between
      Argiers and Sicily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It <i>really was</i> one of the Outer Hebrides,&rdquo; said Gerald, with the
      eagerness that belonged to authorship, &ldquo;so that there could be any amount
      of Scottish songs. Prospero is an old Highland chief, who has been set
      adrift with his daughter&mdash;Francie Vanderkist to wit&mdash;and floated
      up there, obtaining control over the local elves and brownies. Little Fely
      was a most dainty sprite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad you did not make Ariel an electric telegraph,&rdquo; said his aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tempting, but such profanity in the face of Vale Leston was forbidden,
      and so was the comic element, as bad for the teetotallers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But who were the wreckers?&rdquo; asked Anna.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Buccaneers, my dear, singing songs out of the &lsquo;Pirate&rsquo;&mdash;schoolmaster,
      organist, and choir generally. They had captured Prospero&rsquo;s supplanter (he
      was a Highland chief in league with the Whigs) by the leg, while the
      exiled fellow was Jacobite, so as to have the songs dear to the feminine
      mind. They get wrecked on the island, and are terrified by the elves into
      releasing Alonso, etc. Meantime Ferdinand carries logs, forgathers with
      Miranda and Prospero&mdash;and ends&mdash;&rdquo; He flourished his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it wasn&rsquo;t acted!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, we were getting it up before Christmas,&rdquo; said Gerald, &ldquo;and then&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked towards Clement, whose illness had then been at the crisis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very inconsiderate of me,&rdquo; said Clement, smiling, &ldquo;as the old woman said
      when her husband did not die before the funeral cakes were stale. But
      could it not come off at the festival?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Gerald, &ldquo;that the boy is gone, I may be allowed a glass of
      beer. Is that absurdity to last on here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adrian&rsquo;s mother would not let him come on any other terms,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Grinstead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did she also stipulate that he was never to see a horse? Quite as fatal
      to his father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need not point the unreason, but consider how she has suffered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You go the way to make him indulge on the sly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, perhaps,&rdquo; said Clement, &ldquo;but I mean to take the matter up when I
      know the poor little fellow better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gerald gave a little shrug, a relic of his foreign ancestry, and Anna
      proposed a ride to Clipstone to tell Gillian Merrifield of the idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, the dogmatic damsel that came with you the year we had &lsquo;Midsummer
      Night&rsquo;s Dream&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sister to Uncle Bernard&rsquo;s wife. Do you know Jasper Merrifield?
      Clever man. Always photographing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So off they went, Gerald apparently in a resigned state of mind, and came
      upon dogs and girls in an old quarry, where Mysie had dragged them to look
      for pretty stones and young ferns to make little rockeries for the sale of
      work. &lsquo;The Tempest&rsquo; was propounded, and received with acclamation, though
      the Merrifields declared that they could not sing, and their father would
      not allow them to do so in public if they could!
    </p>
    <p>
      Dolores looked on in a sort of silent scorn at a young man who could talk
      so eagerly about &ldquo;a trumpery raree-show,&rdquo; especially for an object that
      she did not care about. None of them knew how far it was the pride of
      authorship and the desire of pastime. Only Jasper said when he heard their
      report&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Underwood is a queer fellow! One never knows where to have him. Socialist
      one minute, old Tory the next.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A dreamer?&rdquo; asked Dolores.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you like to call him so. I believe he will dawdle and dream all his
      life, and never do any good!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps he is waiting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe in waiting,&rdquo; said Jasper, wiping the dust off his
      photographic glasses. &ldquo;Why, he has a lovely moor of his own, and does not
      know how to use it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Conclusive,&rdquo; said Gillian.

     The other won&rsquo;t agree thereto,
       So here they fall to strife;
     With one another they did fight
       About the children&rsquo;s life.
                             Babes in the Wood.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, Aunt Cherry,&rdquo; said Adrian, &ldquo;the fossil forest is to be uncovered
      to-morrow, and Merrifield is going to stay for it, and I&rsquo;m going down with
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fossil forest? What, in the Museum?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed. In Anscombe Cove, they call it. There&rsquo;s a forest buried
      there, and bits come up sometimes. To-morrow there&rsquo;s to be a tremendous
      low tide that will leave a lot of it uncovered, and Merrifield and I mean
      to dig it out, and if there are some duplicate bits they may be had for
      the bazaar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, they have been begging Fergus&rsquo;s duplicates for a collection of
      fossils,&rdquo; said Anna. &ldquo;But can it be safe? A low tide means a high tide,
      you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bosh!&rdquo; returned Adrian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Mohun is sure to know all about the tides, I suppose,&rdquo; said Clement;
      &ldquo;if her nephew goes with her consent I suppose it is safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If&mdash;&rdquo; said Mrs. Grinstead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrian looked contemptuous, and muttered something, on which Anna
      undertook to see Miss Mohun betimes, and judge how the land, or rather the
      sea, lay, and whether Fergus was to be trusted.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be a Saturday, a whole holiday, on which he generally went home
      for Sunday, and Adrian spent the day with him, but the boys&rsquo; present
      scheme was, to take their luncheon with them and spend the whole day in
      Anscombe Cove. This was on the further side of the bay from the marble
      works, shut in by big cliffs, which ran out into long chains of rocks on
      either side, but retreated in the midst, where a little stream from the
      village of Anscombe, or rather from the moorland beyond, made its way to
      the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      The almanacks avouched that on this Saturday there would be an unusually
      low tide, soon after twelve o&rsquo;clock, and Fergus had set his heart on
      investigating the buried forest that there was no doubt had been choked by
      the combined forces of river and sea. So Anna found that notice had been
      sent to Clipstone of his intention of devoting himself to the cove and not
      coming home till the evening, and that his uncle and aunt did not think
      there was any danger, especially as his constant henchman, Davie Blake,
      was going with him, and all the fisher-boys of the place were endowed with
      a certain instinct for their own tides. The only accident Jane Mohun had
      ever known was with a stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anna had no choice but to subside, and the boys started as soon as the
      morning&rsquo;s tide would have gone down sufficiently, carrying baskets for
      their treasures containing their luncheon, and apparently expecting to
      find the forest growing upright under the mud, like a wood full of bushes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cove for which they were bound was on the further side of the chain of
      rocks, nearly two miles from Rockquay, and one of the roads ran along the
      top of the red cliffs that shut it in, with no opening except where the
      stream emerged, and even that a very scanty bank of shingle.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of all assurances, Anna could not be easy about her darling, and
      when afternoon came, and the horses were brought to the door, she coaxed
      Gerald into riding along the cliffs in the Anscombe direction, where there
      was a good road, from whence they could turn down a steep hill into the
      village, and thence go up a wild moor beyond, or else continue along the
      coast for a considerable distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they went out she could see nothing of the boys, only rocks rising
      through an expanse of mud, and the sea breaking beyond. She would have
      preferred continuing the cliff road, but Gerald had a turn for the moor,
      and carried her off through the village of Anscombe, up and up, till they
      had had a lively canter on the moor, and looked far out at sea. When they
      turned back and had reached the cliff road, what had been a sheet of mud
      before had been almost entirely covered with sparkling waves, and there
      was white foam beating against some of the rocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope Adrian is gone home,&rdquo; sighed Anna.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Long ago, depend on it,&rdquo; returned Gerald carelessly; but the next moment
      his tone changed. &ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; he exclaimed, and pointed with his whip to a
      rock, or island, at the end of the range of rocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was much the more long-sighted of the two, and she could only first
      discern that there was something alive upon the rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;is it the boys&mdash;I can&rsquo;t see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell. It is boys, maybe fishers. I must get out to them,&rdquo; he
      replied. &ldquo;Now, Anna, be quiet&mdash;use your senses. It is somebody,
      anyway. I saw the opening of a path down the rock just now,&rdquo; and he threw
      himself off his horse, and threw her the bridle. &ldquo;You ride to the first
      house; find where there is a Coast-guard station, or any fisherman to put
      out a boat. No time to be lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, is it, is it&mdash;&rdquo; cried the bewildered girl, with no hand to feel
      for her eyeglass. &ldquo;Where shall I go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you I can&rsquo;t tell,&rdquo; he shouted in answer to both questions, half
      angrily, already on his way. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t dawdle,&rdquo; and he disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Anna, she had no inclination to dawdle, but the two horses were a
      sore impediment, and she went on some way without seeing any houses.
      Should she turn back to the little road leading down from Anscombe? but
      that was rough and difficult, and could not be undertaken quickly with a
      led horse; or should she make the best of her way to the nearest villas,
      outskirts of Rockquay? However, after a moment the swish of bicycles was
      heard, and up came two young men, clerks apparently, let loose by
      Saturday. They halted, and in answer to her agitated question where there
      was a house, pointed to a path which they said led down to the Preventive
      station, and asked whether there had been an accident, and whether they
      could be of use. They were more able to decide what was best to be done
      than she could be, and they grew more keenly interested when they
      understood for whom she feared. Petros White, brother to Mrs. Henderson,
      and nephew to Aunt Adeline&rsquo;s husband, was one of them, the other, a youth
      also employed at the marble works. This latter took the horses off her
      hands, while Petros showed her the way to the Coast-guard station by a
      steep path, leading to a sort of ledge in the side of the cliff, scooped
      out partly by nature and partly by art, where stood the little houses
      covered with slate.
    </p>
    <p>
      There the mistress was looking out anxiously with a glass; while below,
      the Preventive man was unlocking the boat-house, having already observed
      the peril of the boys, but lamenting the absence of his mate. Petros ran
      down at speed to offer his help, and Anna could only borrow the glass,
      through which she plainly saw the three boys, bare-legged, sitting huddled
      up on the top of the rock, but with the waves still a good way from them,
      and their faces all turned hopefully towards the promontory of rock along
      which she could see Gerald picking his way; but there was evidently a
      terrible and fast-diminishing space between its final point and the rock
      of refuge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anna was about to rush down, and give her help with an oar; but the woman
      withheld her, saying that she would only crowd the boat and retard the
      rescue, for which the two were quite sufficient, only the danger was that
      the current of the stream might make the tide rise rapidly in the bay.
      There were besides so many rocks and shoals, that it was impossible to
      proceed straight across, but it was needful absolutely to pass the rock
      and then turn back on it from the open sea. It was agonizing for the
      sister to watch the devious course, and she turned the glass upon the poor
      boys, plainly making out Adrian&rsquo;s scared, restless look, as he clung to
      the fisher-lad, and Fergus nursing his bag of specimens with his knees
      drawn up. By and by Gerald was wading, and with difficulty preventing
      himself from being washed off the rocks. He paused, saw her, and waved
      encouragement. Then he plunged along, not off his feet, and reached the
      island where the boys were holding out their arms to him. There ensued a
      few moments of apparently hot debate, and she saw, to her horror and
      amazement, that he was thrusting back one boy, who struggled and almost
      fell off the rock in his passion, as Gerald lifted down the little
      fisher-boy. Of course she could not hear the words, &ldquo;Come, boy. No,
      Adrian. Noblesse oblige. I will come back, never fear. I can take but one,
      don&rsquo;t I tell you. I will come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Those were Gerald&rsquo;s words, while Adrian threw himself on the rock, sobbing
      and screaming, while Fergus sat still, hugging his bag. Anna could have
      screamed with her brother, for the boat seemed to have overshot the mark,
      and to be going quite aloof, when all depended upon a few minutes. She
      could hardly hear the words of the Preventive woman, who had found a
      second glass: &ldquo;Never you fear, miss, the boat will be up in time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She could not speak. Her heart was in wild rebellion as she thought of the
      comparative value of her widowed mother&rsquo;s only son with that of the
      fisher-boy, or even of Fergus, one of so large a family. She could not or
      would not look to see what Gerald was doing with the wretched little coast
      boy; but she heard her companion say that the gentleman had put the boy
      down to scramble among the rocks, and he himself was going back to the
      pair on the rock, quite swimming now.
    </p>
    <p>
      She durst look again, and saw that he had scrambled up to the boys&rsquo; perch,
      and had lifted Adrian up, but there was white spray dashing round now. She
      could not see the boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have to keep to the other side,&rdquo; explained the woman. &ldquo;God keep
      them! It will be a near shave. The gentleman is taking off his coat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again there was a leap of foam&mdash;over! over! Then all was blotted out,
      but the woman exclaimed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There they are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One swimming! He is floating the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anna could see no longer. She dashed aside the telescope, then begged to
      be told, then looked again. No prayer would come but &ldquo;Save him! save him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a call quite close.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Norris, sir, put off your boat! Master Fergus&mdash;Oh! is he off?&rdquo;
       and, drenched and breathless, Davy sank down on the ground at their feet,
      quite spent, unable at first to get out a word after those panting ones;
      but in a minute he spoke in answer to the agonized &ldquo;Which? Who?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Master Fergus is swimming. The young sir couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anna recollected how her mother&rsquo;s fears and entreaties had prevented Mr.
      Harewood from teaching Adrian to swim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gent is floating him,&rdquo; added the boy. &ldquo;He took me first, because I could
      get over the rocks and get help soonest. He is a real gentleman, he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anna could not listen to anything but &ldquo;The boat is coming!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but they don&rsquo;t see! They are going away from it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the current,&rdquo; said Mrs. Norris. &ldquo;My man knows what he is about,
      and so does the gentleman, never fear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was another terrible interval, and then boat and swimmers began to
      approach, though in what condition could not be made out. A dark little
      head, no doubt that of Fergus, was lifted in, then another figure was
      raised and taken into the boat; Gerald swam with a hand on it for a short
      distance, then was helped in, and almost at once took an oar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said Mrs. Norris. &ldquo;It will keep out the cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are not coming here,&rdquo; exclaimed Anna. &ldquo;They are going round the
      point.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis more direct, you see, no shoals, and
      the young gentlemen will get to their own homes and beds all the quicker.
      Now, miss, you will come in and take a cup of tea, I am sure you want it,
      and I had just made it when Norris saw the little lads.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, thank you, I must get back at once. My little brother&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, miss, but you&rsquo;ll be able to ride the faster for a bit of bread
      and cup of tea! You are all of a tremble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was true, and to pacify her, Mrs. Norris sent a child up to bid Petros
      have the horses ready, and Anna was persuaded to swallow a little too,
      which happily had cooled enough for her haste, but she hurried off,
      leaving Mrs. Norris to expend her hospitality on Davy, who endured his
      drenching like a fish, and could hardly wait even to swallow thick
      bread-and-butter till he could rush off to hear of his dear Master Fergus.
    </p>
    <p>
      The horses were ready. Petros had been joined by other spectators, and was
      able to entrust the bicycles to one of them, while he himself undertook to
      lead Mr. Underwood&rsquo;s horse to the stable. Anna rode off at as much speed
      or more than was safe downhill among the stones. She had to cross the
      broad parade above the quay, and indeed she believed she had come faster
      than the boat, which had to skirt round the side of the promontory between
      Anscombe Cove and Rockquay. In fact, when she came above the town she
      could see a crowd on the quay and pier, all looking out to sea, and she
      now beheld two boats making for the harbour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she had to ride between walls and villas, and lost sight of all till
      she emerged on the parade, and thought she saw Uncle Clement&rsquo;s hat above
      the crowd as she looked over their heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave her horse to a bystander, who evidently knew her, for a murmur
      went through the crowd of &ldquo;Little chap&rsquo;s sister,&rdquo; and way was made for her
      to get forward, while several rough voices said, &ldquo;All right&rdquo;; &ldquo;Coast-guard
      boat&rdquo;; &ldquo;Not this one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her uncle and Miss Mohun wore standing together. General Mohun could be
      seen in the foremost boat, and they could hear him call out, with a wave
      of his arm&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right! All safe!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hero! Where&rsquo;s Gerald?&rdquo; Miss Mohun exclaimed, as Anna came up to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; and she pointed to the Coast-guard boat. &ldquo;We saw the boys from
      Anscombe Cliff, and he went out to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gerald,&rdquo; exclaimed his uncle, with a ring of gladness in his voice, all
      the more that it was plain that the rower was indeed Gerald, and he began
      to hail those on shore, while Fergus&rsquo;s head rose up from the bottom of the
      boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few moments they were close to the quay, and the little sodden mass
      that purported to be Fergus was calling out&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt Jane! Oh, I&rsquo;ve lost such a bit of aralia. Where&rsquo;s Davy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, take care. He is all right,&rdquo; were Gerald&rsquo;s words.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>He</i> meant Adrian, whom his cousin lifted out, with eyes open and
      conscious, but with limp hands and white exhausted looks, to be carried to
      the fly that stood in waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the other boy safe?&rdquo; asked Gerald anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes; but how could you?&rdquo; were the first words that came to Anna; but
      she felt rebuked by a strange look of utter surprise, and instead of
      answering her he replied to General Mohun&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, no, I&rsquo;ll walk up!&rdquo; as a rough coat was thrown over his dripping
      and scanty garments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wisest way,&rdquo; said the General. &ldquo;Can you, Fergus?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, quite well. Oh, my aralia!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has been half crying all the way home about his fossils,&rdquo; said Gerald.
      &ldquo;Never mind, Fergus; look out for the next spring-tide. Uncle Clem, you
      ought to drive up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clement submitted, clearly unable to resist, and sat down by Anna, who had
      her brother in her arms, rubbing his hands and warming them, caressing
      him, and asking him how he felt, to which the only answer she got was&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was beastly. I have my mouth awfully full of water still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clement made a low murmur of thanksgiving, and Anna, looking up, was
      startled to see how white and helpless he was. The way was happily very
      short, but he had so nearly fainted that Gerald, hurrying on faster uphill
      than the horse to reassure his aunt, lifted him out, not far from
      insensible, and carried him with Sibby&rsquo;s help to his bed in the room on
      the ground-floor, where the remedies were close at hand, Geraldine and
      nurse anxiously administering them; when the first sign of revival he gave
      was pointing to Gerald&rsquo;s dripping condition, and signing to him to go and
      take care of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, yes, boys and all! All right Cherie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he went, swallowing down the glass of stimulant which his aunt turned
      from her other patient for a moment to administer, but she was much too
      anxious about Clement to have thought for any one else, for truly it did
      seem likely that he would be the chief sufferer from the catastrophe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Davy&rsquo;s adventure, as he had lost no clothes, made no more
      impression on his parents than if he had been an amphibious animal or a
      water dog, and when Fergus came out of Beechwood Cottage after having
      changed the few clothes he had retained, and had a good meal, to be driven
      home with his uncle in the dog-cart, his constant henchman was found
      watching for news of him at the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please, sir, I think we&rsquo;ll find your aralia next spring-tide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon General Mohun told him he was a good little chap, and presented
      him with a half-crown, the largest sum he had ever possessed in his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fergus did not come off quite so well, for when the story had been told,
      though his mother had trembled and shed tears of thankfulness as she
      kissed him, and his sisters sprang at him and devoured him, while all the
      time he bemoaned his piece of the stump of an aralia, and a bit of cone of
      a pinus, and other treasures to which imaginative regret lent such an aid,
      that no doubt he would believe the lost contents of his bag to have been
      the most precious articles that he had ever collected; his father,
      however, took him into his study.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fergus,&rdquo; he said gravely, &ldquo;this is the second time your ardour upon your
      pursuits has caused danger and inconvenience to other people, this time to
      yourself too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fergus hung his head, and faltered something about&mdash;&ldquo;Never saw.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, that is the point. Now I say nothing about your pursuits. I am very
      glad you should have them, and be an intelligent lad; but they must not be
      taken up exclusively, so as to drive out all heed to anything else.
      Remember, there is a great difference between courage and foolhardiness,
      and that you are especially warned to be careful if your venturesomeness
      endangers other people&rsquo;s lives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Fergus went off under a sense of his father&rsquo;s displeasure, while Adrian
      lay in his bed, kicking about, admired and petted by his sister, who
      thought every one very unkind and indifferent to him; and when he went to
      sleep, began a letter to her eldest sister describing the adventure and
      his heroism in naming terms, such as on second thoughts she suppressed, as
      likely to frighten her mother, and lead to his immediate recall.

    <p>
      Sunday morning found Anna in a different frame of mind from that of the
      evening before. Uncle Clement had been very ill all night, and the house
      was to be kept as quiet as possible. When Anna came in from early
      Celebration, Aunt Cherry came out looking like a ghost, and very anxious,
      and gave a sigh of relief on Adrian being reported still sound asleep.
      Gerald presently came down, pale and languid, but calling himself all
      right, and loitering over his breakfast till after the boy appeared, so
      rosy and ravenous as to cause no apprehension, except that he should
      devour too much apricot jam, and use his new boots too noisily on the
      stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anna devised walking him to Beechcroft to hear if there were any news of
      Fergus, and though he observed, with a certain sound of contemptuous
      rivalship, that there was no need, for &ldquo;Merrifield was as right as a
      trivet,&rdquo; he was glad enough to get out of doors a little sooner, and
      though he affected to be bored by the kind inquiries of the people they
      met, he carried his head all the higher for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody was at home except General Mohun, but he verified Adrian&rsquo;s
      impression of his nephew&rsquo;s soundness, whatever the mysterious comparison
      might mean; and asked rather solicitously not only after Mr. Underwood but
      after Gerald, who, he said, was a delicate subject to have made such
      exertions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It really was very gallant and very sensible behaviour,&rdquo; he said, as he
      took his hat to walk to St. Andrew&rsquo;s with the brother and sister, but Anna
      was conscious of a little pouting in Adrian&rsquo;s expression, and displeasure
      in his stumping steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gerald came to church, but went to sleep in the sermon, and had altogether
      such a worn-out look that no one could help remembering that he had never
      been very strong, and had gone through much exertion the day before, nor
      could he eat much of the mid-day meal. Mrs. Grinstead, who was more at
      ease about her brother, looked anxiously at him, and with a kind of smile
      the word &ldquo;Apres&rdquo; passed between them. The Sunday custom was for Clement to
      take Adrian to say his Catechism, and have a little instruction before
      going out walking, but as this could not be on this day, Anna and he were
      to go out for a longer walk than usual, so as to remove disturbance from
      the household. Gerald declined, of course, and was left extended on the
      sofa; but just as Anna and Adrian had made a few steps along the street,
      and the boy had prevailed not to walk to Clipstone, as she wished, but to
      go to the cliffs, that she might hear the adventure related in sight of
      the scene of action, he discovered that he had left a glove. He was very
      particular about Sunday walking in gloves in any public place, and rushed
      back to find it, leaving his sister waiting. Presently he came tearing
      back and laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you find it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes; it was in the drawing-room. And what else do you think I found?
      Why, Cherie administering&rdquo;&mdash;and he pointed down his throat, and made
      a gulp with a wild grimace of triumph. &ldquo;On the sly! Ha! ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anna felt as if the ground had opened under her feet, but she answered
      gravely&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Gerald went through a great deal yesterday, and is quite knocked up,
      so no wonder he needs some strengthening medicine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strengthening grandmother! Don&rsquo;t you think I know better than that?&rdquo; he
      cried, with a caper and a grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you had to have some cordial when you were taken out of the
      water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t you know what it was?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know the fisher-people carry stuff about with them in case of
      accidents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way with girls&mdash;just to think one knows nothing at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you know, Adrian?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Know? Why, I haven&rsquo;t been about with Kit and Ted Harewood for nothing!
      Jolly good larks it is to see how all of you take for granted that a
      fellow never knew the taste of anything but tea and milk-and-water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what do you know the taste of?&rdquo; she asked, with an earnestness that
      provoked the boy to tease and put on a boasting manner, so that she could
      not tell how much he was pretending for the sake of amazing and tormenting
      her, in which he certainly succeeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, his attention was diverted by coming round the corner to where
      there was a view of Anscombe Bay, when he immediately began to fight his
      battles o&rsquo;er again, and show where they had been groping in the mud and
      seaweed in pursuit of sea-urchins, and stranded star-fish, and crabs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it wasn&rsquo;t a forest after all, it was just a sell&mdash;nothing but
      mud and weed, only Fergus would go and poke in it, and there were horrid
      great rough stones and rocks too, and I tumbled over one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anna here became conscious that the whole place was the resort of the
      afternoon promenaders of Rockquay, great and small, of all ranks and
      degrees, belonging to the &ldquo;middle class&rdquo; or below it, and that they might
      themselves become the object of attention; and she begged her brother to
      turn back and wait till they could have the place to themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These are a disgusting lot of cads,&rdquo; he agreed, &ldquo;but there won&rsquo;t be such
      a jolly tide another time. I declare I see the very rock where I saw the
      sea-mouse&mdash;out there! red and shiny at the top.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here a well-dressed man, who had just come up the Coast-guard path, put
      aside his pipe, and taking off his hat, deferentially asked&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I the honour of addressing Sir Adrian Vanderkist?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Adrian replied with a gracious nod and gesture towards his straw hat, and
      in another moment Anna found him answering questions, and giving his own
      account of the adventure to the inquirer, who, she had little doubt, was a
      reporter, and carrying his head, if possible, higher in consequence as he
      told how Fergus Merrifield had lingered over his stones, and all the rest
      after his own version. She did not hear the whole, having had to answer
      the inquiries of one of the bicycle friends of the previous day, but when
      her attention was free she heard&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the young lady, Sir Adrian?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young lady! Thank goodness, we were not bothered with any of that sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, Sir Adrian, I understood that there was a young lady, Miss
      Aurelia, that Master Merrifield was lamenting, as if she had met with a
      watery grave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! ha! Aralia was only the name of a bit of fossil kind of a stick that
      Merrifield had us down there to find in the fossil forest. I&rsquo;m sure I saw
      no forest, only bits of mud and stuff! But he found a bit, sure enough,
      and was ready to break his heart when he had to leave his bag behind him
      on the rock. Aralia a young lady! That&rsquo;s a good one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He forgathered with a school-fellow on the way home, and Anna heard little
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, however, there arrived the daily local paper, addressed to
      Sir Adrian Vanderkist, Bart., and it was opened by him at breakfast-time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say! Look here! &lsquo;Dangerous Accident in Anscombe. A Youthful Baronet in
      peril!&rsquo; What asses people are!&rdquo; he added, with an odd access of the
      gratified shame of seeing himself for the first time in print. But he did
      not proceed to read aloud; there evidently was something he did not like,
      and he was very near pocketing it and rushing off headlong to school with
      it, if his aunt and Anna had not entreated or commanded for it, when he
      threw it over with an uncomplimentary epithet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just what I was afraid of when I saw the man talking to him!&rdquo; exclaimed
      Anna. &ldquo;Oh, listen!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The young Sir Adrian Vanderkist, at present residing at St. Andrew&rsquo;s
      Rock with his aunt, Mrs. Grinstead, and the Rev. E. C. Underwood, and who
      is a pupil at Mrs. Edgar&rsquo;s academy for young gentlemen, was, we are
      informed, involved in the most imminent danger, together with a son of
      General Sir Jasper Merrifield, K.G.C., a young gentleman whose remarkable
      scientific talent and taste appear to have occasioned the peril of the
      youthful party, from whence they were rescued by Gerald F. Underwood,
      Esq., of Vale Leston.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s all that?&rdquo; said Gerald F. Underwood, Esquire, sauntering in and
      kissing his aunt. &ldquo;Good-morning. How is Uncle Clement this morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much better; I think he will be up by and by,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Grinstead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What bosh have you got there? The reporters seized on their prey, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Sir Jasper!&rdquo; exclaimed Anna, who could see through the blinds
      from where she sat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Jasper had driven over with his little son, and, after leaving him at
      school, had come to inquire for Mr. Underwood, and to obtain a fuller
      account of the accident, having already picked up a paper and glanced at
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid my little scamp led them into the danger,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;Scientific taste forsooth! Science is as good a reason as anything else
      for getting into scrapes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really,&rdquo; said Gerald, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say I think your boy came out the worst in
      it, though I must own the Rockquay Advertiser bestows most of the honours
      of the affair on the youthful baronet! You say he blew his own trumpet,&rdquo;
       added Gerald, turning to Anna.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The reporter came and beset us,&rdquo; said Anna, in a displeased voice. &ldquo;I did
      not hear all that passed, but of course Adrian told him what he told me,
      only those people make things sound ridiculous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To begin with,&rdquo; said Gerald, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think Fergus, or at any rate Davy
      Blake, was in fault. They tried to go home in good time, having an
      instinct for tides, but Adrian was chasing a sea-mouse or some such game,
      and could not be brought back, and then he fell over a slippery rock, and
      had to be dragged out of a hole, and by that time the channel of the
      Anscombe stream was too deep, at least for him, who has been only too
      carefully guarded from being amphibious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! that did not transpire at home,&rdquo; said Sir Jasper. &ldquo;Boys are so
      reserved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Grinstead and Anna looked rather surprised. Anna even ventured&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought Fergus got too absorbed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So did I,&rdquo; said his father dryly. &ldquo;And he did not justify himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M&mdash;m&mdash;m,&rdquo; went on Gerald, skimming the article.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read it,&rdquo; cried Anna. &ldquo;You know none of us have seen it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gerald continued&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Their perilous position having been observed from Anscombe cliffs, Mr.
      G. F. Underwood of Vale Leston heroically&rsquo; (i.e. humbugically) &lsquo;made his
      way out to their assistance, while a boat was put off by the Coast-guard,
      and that of Mr. Carter, fisherman, from Rockquay was launched somewhat
      later.&rsquo; We could not see either of them, you know. My eye, this is coming
      it strong! &lsquo;The young baronet generously insisted that the little
      fisher-boy, David Blake, who had accompanied them, should first be placed
      in safety&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; exclaimed Anna. &ldquo;I saw, and I wondered, but I thought it was
      his doing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You saw?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, in the Coast-guard&rsquo;s telescope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! That is a new feature in the case!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he did not insist?&rdquo; said Mrs. Grinstead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was with the wrong side of his mouth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why did you send the fisher-boy first, when after all his life was
      less important?&rdquo; exclaimed Anna, breaking forth at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First, for the reason that I strove to impress on &lsquo;the youthful baronet,&rsquo; 
      Noblesse oblige. Secondly, that Davy knew how to make his way along the
      rocks, and also knew where to find the Preventive station. I could leave
      him to get on, as I could not have done with the precious Adrian, and that
      gave a much better chance for us all. It was swimming work by the time I
      got back, and by that time I thought the best alternative for any of us
      was to keep hold as long as we could, and then keep afloat as best we
      might till we were picked up. Your boy was the hero of it all. Adrian was
      so angry with me for my disrespect that I could hardly have got him to
      listen to me if Fergus had not made him understand, that to let himself be
      passive and be floated by me till the boats came up was the only thing to
      be done. There was one howl when he had to let go his beloved aralia, but
      he showed his soldier blood, and behaved most manfully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am most thankful to hear it,&rdquo; said his father, &ldquo;and especially thankful
      to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! there was not much real danger,&rdquo; said Gerald lightly, &ldquo;to any one who
      could swim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Adrian could not,&rdquo; said Anna. &ldquo;Oh! Gerald, what do we not owe to
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must be off,&rdquo; said Sir Jasper; &ldquo;I must see about a new jacket for my
      boy. By the bye, do you know how the little Davy fared in the matter of
      clothes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better than any of us,&rdquo; said Gerald. &ldquo;He was far too sharp to go
      mud-larking in anything that would be damaged, and had his boots safe laid
      up in a corner. I wish mine were equally safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Jasper&rsquo;s purchases were not confined to boots and jacket, but as
      compensation for his hard words included a certain cabinet full of drawers
      that had long been Fergus&rsquo;s cynosure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anna and her aunt were much concerned at what was said of Adrian, and
      still more at the boastful account that he seemed to have given; but then
      something, as Mrs. Grinstead observed, must be allowed for the reporter&rsquo;s
      satisfaction in having interviewed a live baronet. Each of the parties
      concerned had one hero, and if the Merrifields&rsquo; was Fergus, to their own
      great surprise and satisfaction, Aunt Cherry was very happy over her own
      especial boy, Gerald, and certainly it was an easier task than to accept
      &ldquo;the youthful baronet&rdquo; at his own valuation or that of the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Grinstead considered whether to try to make him less conceited about
      it, and show him his want of truth. She consulted his uncle about it,
      showing the newspaper, and telling, and causing Gerald to tell, the
      history of the accident, which Clement had not been fit to hear all the
      day before.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was still in bed, but quite ready to attend to anything, and he laughed
      over the account, which she illustrated by the discoveries she had made
      from the united witnesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is it not delightful to see for once what Gerald really is?&rdquo; she
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he seems to have behaved gallantly,&rdquo; said his uncle; &ldquo;and I won&rsquo;t
      say just what might have been expected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One does expect something of an Underwood,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little Merrifield too, who saw the danger coming, deserves more honour
      than he seems to have taken to himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he accepted severity from that stern father of his, who seems very
      sorry for it now. It is curious how those boys&rsquo; blood comes out in the
      matter&mdash;chasser de race.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must allow something for breeding. Fergus had not been the idol of a
      mother and sisters, and Gerald remembered his father in danger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I can never be glad enough that he has that remembrance of him! How
      like him he grows! That unconscious imitation is so curious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the other day, when I had been dozing, I caught myself calling out
      that he was whistling &lsquo;Johnny Cope&rsquo; so loud that he would be heard in the
      shop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He seems to be settling down more happily here than I expected. I
      sometimes wonder if there is any attraction at Clipstone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No harm if there were, except&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Except what? Early marriage might be the very best thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps, though sometimes I doubt whether it is well for a man to have
      gone through the chief hopes and crises of life so soon. He looks out for
      fresh excitement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are so many stages in life,&rdquo; said Geraldine, sighing. &ldquo;And with all
      his likenesses, Gerald is quite different from any of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I suppose each generation feels with those who succeed it. Nor do I
      feel as if I understood the Universities to-day as I did Cambridge thought
      of old. We can do nothing but wait and pray, and put out a hand where we
      see cause.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where we see! It is the not seeing that is so trying. The being sure that
      there is more going on within than is allowed to meet one&rsquo;s eye, and that
      one is only patronized as an old grandmother&mdash;quite out of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think the conditions of life and thought are less simple than in our
      day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to come to the present. What is to be done about Adrian&mdash;the one
      who was not a hero, though he made himself out so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably he really thought so. He is a mere child, you know, and it was
      his first adventure, before he has outgrown the days of cowardice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He need not have told stories.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Depend upon it, he hardly knew that he did so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had the reporter to help him certainly, and the &lsquo;Rockquay Advertiser&rsquo; 
      may not keep to the stern veracity and simplicity of the &lsquo;Pursuivant&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And was proud to interview a live baronet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what shall we do&mdash;Anna and I, I mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Write the simple facts to Vale Leston, and then let it alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. He would think your speaking mere nagging. Preserve an ominous
      silence if he speaks. His school-fellows will be his best cure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he did seem ashamed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clement was right. The boy&rsquo;s only mention of the paragraph was once as
      &ldquo;that beastly thing&rdquo;; and Anna discovered from Valetta Merrifield, that
      whatever satisfaction he might have derived from it had been effectually
      driven out of him by the &ldquo;fellows&rdquo; at Mrs. Edgar&rsquo;s, who had beset him with
      all their force of derision, called him nothing but the &ldquo;youthful Bart.,&rdquo;
       and made him ashamed as none of the opposite sex or of maturer years could
      ever have succeeded in doing. Valetta said Fergus had tried to stop it,
      but there had certainly been one effect, namely, that Adrian was less
      disposed to be &ldquo;Merry&rsquo;s&rdquo; shadow than heretofore, and seemed inclined
      instead to take up with the other seniors.
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing, however, was certain. Gerald enjoyed a good deal more
      consideration among the Clipstone damsels than before. True, as Jasper
      said, it was only what any one would have done; but he had done it, and
      proved himself by no means inferior to &ldquo;any one,&rdquo; and Fergus regarded him
      as a true hero, which had a considerable effect on his sisters, the more
      perhaps because Jasper derided their admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were doubly bent on securing him for a contributor to the Mouse-trap.
      They almost thought of inviting him to their Browning afternoons, but
      decided that he would not appreciate the feminine company, though he did
      so often have a number of the &lsquo;Censor&rsquo; to discuss it with Dolores,
      whenever they met him.

      The Matrons, otherwise denominated lady patronesses, met in committee,
      Miss Mohun being of course the soul and spirit of all, though Mrs.
      Ellesmere, as the wife of the rector of old Rockstone Church, was the
      president, Lady Flight, one of the most interested, was there, also Lady
      Merrifield, dragged in to secure that there was nothing decided on
      contrary to old-world instincts, Mrs. Grinstead, in right of the musical
      element that her brother promised, the beautiful Mrs. Henderson, to
      represent the marble works, Mrs. Simmonds of the Cliff Hotel, the
      Mayoress, and other notables.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time was fixed for the first week in August, the only one when
      engagements would permit the Rotherwood family to be present for the
      opening, and when the regatta was apt to fill Rockquay with visitors. The
      place was to be the top of the cliffs of Rockstone, where the gardens of
      the Cliff Hotel, of Beechcroft Cottage, Rocca Marina, and Carrara,
      belonging respectively to Miss Mohun, Mr. White, and Captain Henderson,
      lay close together separated by low walls, and each with a private door
      opening on a path along the top of the cliffs. They could easily be made
      to communicate together, by planks laid over the boundaries, and they had
      lawns adapted for tents, etc., and Rocca Marina rejoiced in a shrubbery
      and conservatories that were a show in themselves, and would be kindly
      lent by Mr. and Mrs. White, though health compelled them to be absent and
      to resort to Gastein. The hotel likewise had a large well-kept garden,
      where what Mrs. Simmonds called a pavilion, &ldquo;quite mediaeval,&rdquo; was in
      course of erection, and could be thrown open on the great day.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was rather &ldquo;tea-gardenish,&rdquo; but it could be made available for the
      representation of The Outlaw&rsquo;s Isle. Lancelot made a hurried visit to
      study the place, and review the forces, and decided that it was
      practicable. There could be a gallery at one end for the spectators, and
      the outer end toward the bay could be transformed into a stage, with room
      for the orchestra, and if the weather were favourable the real sea could
      be shown in the background. The scenes had been painted by the clever
      fingers at Vale Leston. It remained to cast the parts. Lancelot himself
      would be Prospero, otherwise Alaster Maclan, and likewise conductor,
      bringing with him the school-master of Vale Leston, who could supply his
      part as conductor when he was on the stage. His little boy Felix would be
      Ariel, the other elves could be selected from the school-children, and the
      local Choral Society would supply the wreckers and the wrecked. But the
      demur was over Briggs, a retired purser, who had always had a monopoly of
      sea-songs, and who looked on the boatswain as his right, and was likely to
      roar every one down. Ferdinand would be Gerald, under the name of Angus,
      but the difficulty was his Miranda&mdash;Mona as she was called. The
      Vanderkists could not be asked to perform in public, nor would Sir Jasper
      Merrifield have consented to his daughters doing so, even if they could
      have sung, and it had been privately agreed that none of the other young
      ladies of Rockquay could be brought forward, especially as there was no
      other grown-up female character.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My wife might undertake it,&rdquo; said Lancelot, &ldquo;but her voice is not her
      strong point, and she would be rather substantial for a Miranda.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be rather like finding a mother instead of a wife&mdash;with all
      respect to my Aunt Daisy,&rdquo; laughed Gerald.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the bye, I&rsquo;m sure I once heard a voice, somewhere down by the sea,
      that would be perfect,&rdquo; exclaimed Lance. &ldquo;Sweet and powerful, fresh and
      young, just what is essential. I heard it when I was in quest of crabs
      with my boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know!&rdquo; exclaimed Gerald, &ldquo;the Little Butterfly, as they call her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At a cigar-shop,&rdquo; said Lance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Schnetterling&rsquo;s. Not very respectable,&rdquo; put in Lady Flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Decidedly attractive to the little boys, though,&rdquo; said Gerald. &ldquo;Sweets,
      fishing-tackle, foreign stamps, cigars. I went in once to see whether
      Adrian was up to mischief there, and the Mother Butterfly looked at me as
      if I had seven heads; but I just got a glimpse of the girl, and, as my
      uncle says, she would make an ideal Mona, or Miranda.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lydia Schnetterling,&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Flight. &ldquo;She is a very pretty girl
      with a nice voice. You remember her, Miss Mohun, at our concerts? A lovely
      fairy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember her well. I thought she was foreign, and a Roman Catholic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So her mother professes&mdash;a Hungarian. The school officer sent her to
      school, and she did very well there, Sunday-school and all, and was a
      monitor. She was even confirmed. Her name is really Ludmilla, and Lida is
      the correct contraction. But when I wanted her to be apprenticed as a
      pupil-teacher, the mother suddenly objected that she is a Roman Catholic,
      but I very much doubt the woman&rsquo;s having any religion at all. I wrote to
      the priest about her, but I believe he could make nothing of her. Still,
      Lydia is a very nice girl&mdash;comes to church, and has not given up the
      Choral Society.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is a remarkably nice good girl,&rdquo; added Mrs. Henderson. &ldquo;She came to
      me, and entreated that I would speak for her to be taken on at the marble
      works.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have her there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but I am much afraid that her talents do not lie in the way of high
      promotion, and I think if she does not get wages enough to satisfy her
      mother, she is in dread of being made to sing at public-houses and
      music-halls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That nice refined girl!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I am sure the idea is dreadful to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could you not put her in the way of getting trained?&rdquo; asked Gerald of his
      uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must hear her first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will bring her up to the Choral Society tonight,&rdquo; said Mr. Flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you call her?&rdquo; said Geraldine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some German or foreign name, Schnetterling, and the school calls her
      Lydia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment the council was invaded, as it sat in Miss Mohun&rsquo;s
      drawing-room, upon rugs and wicker chairs, to be refreshed with tea. In
      burst a whole army of Merrifields, headed by little Primrose, now a tall
      girl of twelve years old, more the pet of the family than any of her
      elders had been allowed to be. Her cry was&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, mamma, mamma, here&rsquo;s the very one for the captain of the buccaneers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The startling announcement was followed by the appearance of a tall,
      stalwart, handsome young man of a certain naval aspect, whom Lady
      Merrifield introduced as Captain Armytage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must congratulate him, Gillian,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I see you are gazetted as
      commander.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Primrose, who had something of the licence of the youngest, observed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have been telling him all about it. He used to be Oliver Cromwell in
      &lsquo;How Do You Like It?&rsquo; and now he will be a buccaneer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oliver Cromwell, you silly child!&rdquo; burst out Gillian, with a little
      shake, while the rest fell into fits of laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear it was a less distinguished part,&rdquo; said Captain Armytage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I understand that you will help us?&rdquo; said Lancelot. &ldquo;I heard of you
      at Devereux Castle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you heard much of my capabilities, especially musical ones.
      I was the stick of the party,&rdquo; said Captain Armytage.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was explained that Captain Armytage had actually arrived that afternoon
      at the Cliff Hotel, and had walked over to call at Clipstone, whence he
      found the young ladies setting out to walk to Rockstone. He could not deny
      that he had acted and sung, though, as he said, his performance in both
      cases was vile. Little Miss Primrose had most comically taken upon her to
      patronize him, and to offer him as buccaneer captain had been a freak of
      her own, hardly to be accounted for, except that Purser Briggs&rsquo;s
      unsuitableness had been discussed in her presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Primrose is getting to be a horrid little forward thing,&rdquo; observed
      Gillian to her aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A child of the present,&rdquo; said Miss Mohun. &ldquo;Infant England! But her
      suggestion seems to be highly opportune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe he can sing,&rdquo; growled Gillian, &ldquo;and it will be just an
      excuse for his hanging about here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was something in Gillian&rsquo;s &ldquo;savagery&rdquo; which gave Aunt Jane a curious
      impression, but she kept it to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late in the evening Lance appeared in his sister&rsquo;s drawing-room with&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have more hopes of it. I did not think it was feasible when Anna wrote
      to me, but I see my way better now. That parson, Flight, has a good notion
      of drilling, and that recruit of the little Merrifield girl, Captain
      Armytage, is worth having.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he roared like a sucking dove we would have him, only to silence that
      awful boatswain,&rdquo; said Gerald; &ldquo;and as to the little Cigaretta, she is a
      born prima donna.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Miranda? Are you content with her?&rdquo; said his aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is to the manner born. Lovely voice, acts like a dragon, and has an
      instinct how to stand and how to hold her hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coming in drolly with her prim dress and bearing. Though she was
      dreadfully frightened,&rdquo; said Lance. &ldquo;Being half-foreign accounts for
      something, I suppose, but it is odd how she reminds me of some one. No
      doubt it is of some singer at a concert. What did they say was her name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ludmilla Schnetterling, the Little Butterfly they call her. Foreign on
      both sides apparently,&rdquo; said Gerald. &ldquo;Those dainty ankles never were bred
      on English clods.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder what her mother is,&rdquo; said Mrs. Grinstead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the bye, I think it must have been her mother that I saw that morning
      when little Felix dragged me to a cigar-shop in quest of an ornamental
      crab&mdash;a handsome, slatternly hag sort of woman, who might have been
      on the stage,&rdquo; said Lance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sells fishing-tackle, twine, all sorts,&rdquo; came from Adrian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you been there?&rdquo; asked his sister, rather disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course! All the fellows go! It is the jolliest place for&rdquo;&mdash;he
      paused a moment&mdash;&ldquo;candies and ginger-beer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have thought there were nicer places!&rdquo; sighed Anna.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have yet to learn that there is a period of life when it is a joy to
      slip out of as much civilization as possible,&rdquo; said Lance, putting his
      sentence in involved form so as to be the less understood by the boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you say that Flight had got hold of them?&rdquo; asked Clement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hardly. They are R.C.&lsquo;s, it seems; and as to the Mother Butterfly, I
      should think there was not much to get hold of in her; but Mrs. Henderson
      takes interest in her marble-workers, and the girl is the sort of refined,
      impressible creature that one longs to save, if possible. To-morrow I am
      going to put you all through your parts, Master Gerald, so don&rsquo;t you be
      out of the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One submits to one&rsquo;s fate,&rdquo; said Gerald, &ldquo;hoping that virtue may be its
      own reward, as it is in the matter of &lsquo;The Inspector&rsquo;s Tour&rsquo;, which the
      &lsquo;Censor&rsquo; accepts, really enthusiastically for a paper, though the
      Mouse-trap would have found it&mdash;what shall I say?&mdash;a weasel in
      their snare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does it indeed?&rdquo; cried Anna, delighted. &ldquo;I saw there was a letter by this
      last post.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye&mdash;invites more from the same pen,&rdquo; he replied lazily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too much of weasel for the &lsquo;Pursuivant&rsquo; even?&rdquo; said Geraldine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Lance; &ldquo;these young things are apt to tear our old traps and
      flags to pieces. By the bye, who is this Captain Armytage, who happily
      will limit Purser Briggs to &lsquo;We split, we split, we split,&rsquo; or something
      analogous?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; said Gerald, &ldquo;that he joined the Wills-of-the-Wisp, that
      company which was got up by Sir Lewis Willingham, and played at Devereux
      Castle a year or two ago. Some one told me they were wonderfully effective
      for amateurs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That explains the acquaintance with Lady Merrifield,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Grinstead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Anna. &ldquo;Mysie told me all about it; and how Mr. David
      Merrifield married the nicest of them all, and how much they liked this
      Captain Armytage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was not Mysie there when he arrived?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she was gone to see the Henderson children, but Gillian looked a
      whole sheaf of daggers at him. You know what black brows Gillian has, and
      she drew them down like thunder,&rdquo; and Anna imitated as well as her fair
      open brows would permit, &ldquo;turning as red as fire all the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That certainly means something,&rdquo; said Geraldine, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to see Gillian in love,&rdquo; laughed Anna; &ldquo;and I really think
      she is afraid of it, she looked so fierce.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next evening there was time for a grand review in the parish
      school-room of all possible performers on the spot. In the midst, however,
      a sudden fancy flashed across Lancelot that there was something curiously
      similar between those two young people who occupied the stage, or what was
      meant to be such. Their gestures corresponded to one another, their voices
      had the same ring, and their eyes wore almost of the same dark colour. Now
      Gerald&rsquo;s eyes had always been the only part of him that was not Underwood,
      and had never quite accorded with his fair complexion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hungarian, I suppose,&rdquo; said Lance to himself, but he was not quite
      satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      What struck him as strange was that though dreadfully shy and frightened
      when off the stage, as soon as she appeared upon it, though not yet in
      costume, she seemed to lose all consciousness that she was not Mona.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps Mrs. Henderson could have told him. Her husband being manager and
      partner at Mr. White&rsquo;s marble works, she had always taken great interest
      in the young women employed, had actually attended to their instruction,
      assisted in judging of their designs, and used these business relations to
      bring them into inner contact with her, so that her influence had become
      very valuable. She was at the little room which she still kept at the
      office, when there was a knock at the door, and &ldquo;Miss Schnetterling&rdquo;
       begged to speak to her. She felt particularly tender towards the girl, who
      was evidently doing her best in a trying and dangerous position, and after
      the first words it came out&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Henderson, do you think I must be Mona?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any real objection, Lydia? Mr. Flight and all of them seem to
      wish it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and I can&rsquo;t bear not to oblige Mr. Flight, who has been so good, so
      good!&rdquo; cried Lydia, with a foreign gesture, clasping her hands. &ldquo;Indeed,
      perhaps my mother would not let me off. That is what frightens me. But if
      you or some real lady could put me aside they could not object.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not understand you, my dear. You would meet with no unpleasantness
      from any one concerned, and you can be with the fairy children. Are you
      shy? You were not so in the fairy scenes last winter&mdash;you acted very
      nicely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, I liked it then. It carries me away; but&mdash;oh! I am afraid!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please tell me, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lydia lowered her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must tell you, Mrs. Henderson, mother was a singer in public once, and
      a dancer; and oh! they were so cruel to her, beat her, and starved her,
      and ill-used her. She used to tell me about it when I was very little, but
      now I have grown older, and the people like my voice, she is quite
      changed. She wants me to go and sing at the Herring-and-a-Half, but I
      won&rsquo;t, I won&rsquo;t&mdash;among all the tipsy men. That was why she would not
      let me be a pupil-teacher, and why she will not see a priest. And now&mdash;now
      I am sure she has a plan in her head. If I do well at this operetta, and
      people like me, I am sure she will get the man at the circus to take me,
      by force perhaps, and then it would be all her life over again, and I know
      that was terrible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor Ludmilla burst into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, if she suffered so much she would not wish to expose you to the
      same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. She is in trouble about the shop&mdash;the cigars. Oh! I
      should not have told! You won&rsquo;t&mdash;you won&rsquo;t&mdash;Mrs. Henderson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you need not fear, I have nothing to do with that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think,&rdquo; Lydia whispered again, &ldquo;that she cares for me as she used
      to do when I was a little thing. Now that I care for my duty, and all that
      you and Mr. Flight have taught me, she is angry, and laughs at English
      notions. I was in hopes when I came to work here that my earnings would
      have satisfied her, but they don&rsquo;t, and I don&rsquo;t seem to get on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Henderson could not say that her success was great, but she ventured
      as much as to tell her that Captain Henderson could prevent any attempt to
      send her away without her consent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! but if my mother went too you could not hinder it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sixteen, my dear? Then you could not be taken against your will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not till December. And oh! that gentleman, the conductor, he knew all
      about it, I could see, and by and by I saw him lingering about the shop,
      as if he wanted to watch me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Lancelot Underwood! Oh, my dear, you need not be afraid of him, he is
      a brother of Mrs. Grinstead&rsquo;s, a connection of Miss Mohun&rsquo;s; and though he
      is such a musician, it is quite as an amateur. But, Lydia, I do think that
      if you sing your best, he may very likely be able to put you in a way to
      make your talent available so as to satisfy your mother, without leading
      to anything so undesirable and dangerous as a circus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you think I ought&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a dangerous thing to give advice, but really, my dear, I do think
      more good is likely to come of this than harm.&rdquo;

     The wisest aunt telling the saddest tale.

    <p>
      The earlier proofs of the Mouse-trap were brought by Lance, who had spent
      more time in getting them into shape than his wife approved, and they were
      hailed with rapture by the young ladies on seeing themselves for the first
      time in print. As to Gerald, he had so long been bred&mdash;as it were&mdash;to
      journalism that, young as he was, he had caught the trick, and &lsquo;The
      Inspector&rsquo;s Tour&rsquo; had not only been welcomed by the &lsquo;Censor&rsquo;, but portions
      had been copied into other papers, and there was a proposal of publishing
      it in a separate brochure. It would have made the fortune of the
      Mouse-trap, if it had not been so contrary to its principles, and it had
      really been sent to them in mischief, together with The &lsquo;Girton Girl&rsquo;, of
      which some were proud, though when she saw it in print, with a lyre and
      wreath on the page, sober Mysie looked grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think it profane to parody Jane Taylor?&rdquo; said Gerald.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but I thought it might hurt some people&rsquo;s feelings, and discourage
      them, if we laugh at the High School.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Dolores goes to give lectures there,&rdquo; exclaimed Valetta.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody is discouraged by a little good-humoured banter,&rdquo; said Gillian.
      &ldquo;Nobody with any stuff in them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There must be some training in chaff though,&rdquo; said Gerald, &ldquo;or they don&rsquo;t
      know how to take it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And in point of fact,&rdquo; said Dolores, &ldquo;the upper tradesmen&rsquo;s daughters
      come off with greater honours in the High School than do the young
      gentlewomen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very wholesome for the young Philistines,&rdquo; said Gerald. &ldquo;The daughters of
      self-made men may well surpass in energy those settled on their lees.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gerald and Dolores were standing with their backs to the wall of Anscombe
      Church, which Jasper Merrifield and Mysie were zealously photographing,
      the others helping&mdash;or hindering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought upper tradesfolk were the essence of Philistines,&rdquo; returned
      Dolores.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The elder generation&mdash;especially if he is the son of the energetic
      man. The younger are more open to ideas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The stolid Conservative is the one who has grown up while his father was
      making his fortune, the third generation used to be the gentleman, now he
      is the man who is tired of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tired of it, aye!&rdquo; with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why you are a man with a pedigree!&rdquo; she returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pedigrees don&rsquo;t hinder&mdash;what shall I call it?&mdash;the sense of
      being fettered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One lives in fetters,&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;And the better one likes one&rsquo;s
      home, the harder it is to shake them off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned and looked full at her, then exclaimed, &ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; and paused,
      adding, &ldquo;I wonder what you want. Has it a form?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, I mean to give lectures. I should like to see the world, and
      study physical science in every place, then tell the next about it. I read
      all I can, and I think I shall get consent to give some elementary
      lectures at the High School, though Uncle Jasper does not half like it,
      but I must get some more training to do the thing rightly. I thought of
      University College. Could you get me any information about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Easily; but you&rsquo;ll have to conquer the horror of the elders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know. They think one must learn atheism and all sorts of things there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might go in for physical science at Oxford or Cambridge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect that is all my father would allow. In spite of the colonies, he
      has all the old notions about women, and would do nothing Aunt Lily really
      protested against.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are lucky to have a definite plan and notion to work for. Now fate
      was so unkind as to make me a country squire, and not only that, but one
      bound down, like Gulliver among the Liliputians, with all manner of cords
      by all the dear good excellent folks, who look on that old mediaeval den
      with a kind of fetish-worship, sprung of their having been kept out of it
      so long, and it would be an utter smash of all their hearts if I uttered a
      profane word against it. I would as soon be an ancient Egyptian drowning a
      cat as move a stone of it. It is a lovely sort of ancient Pompeii, good to
      look at now and then, but not to be bound down to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like Beechcroft Court, a fossil. It is very well there are such places.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but not to be the hope of them. It is my luck. If my eldest uncle,
      who had toiled in a bookseller&rsquo;s shop all his youth and reigned like a
      little king, had not gone and got killed in a boating accident, there he
      would be the ruling Sir Roger de Coverley of the county, a pillar of
      Church and State, and I should be a free man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t they let you go about, and see everything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, I am welcome to do a little globe-trotting. They are no fools; if
      they were I should not care half so much; but wherever I went, there would
      be a series of jerks from my string, and not having an integument of
      rhinoceros hide, I could not disregard them without a sore more raw than I
      care to carry about. After all, it is only a globe, and one gets back to
      the same place again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Men have so many openings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not rich enough for Parliament, and if I were, maybe it would be
      worse for their hearts,&rdquo; he said, with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s journalism, a great power.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but to put my name to all I could&mdash;and long to say&mdash;would
      be an equal horror to the dear folks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet you are helping on this concern.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, but partly pour passer le temps, partly because I really want to
      hear &lsquo;The Outlaws Isle&rsquo; performed, and all under protest that the windmill
      will soon be swept away by the stream.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, yes,&rdquo; cried Dolores. &ldquo;They hope to regulate the stream. They
      might as well hope to regulate Mississippi.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well-chosen simile! The current is slow and sluggish, but irresistible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better than stagnating or sticking fast in the mud.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Though the mud may be full of fair blossoms and sweet survivals,&rdquo; said
      Gerald sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, people in the old grooves are delightful,&rdquo; said Dolores, &ldquo;but one
      can&rsquo;t live, like them, with a heart in G. F. S., like my Aunt Jane, really
      the cleverest of any of us! Or like Mysie, not stupid, but wrapped up in
      her classes, just scratching the surface. Now, if I went in for good works
      I would go to the bottom&mdash;down to the slums.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Slums are one&rsquo;s chief interest,&rdquo; said Gerald; &ldquo;but no doubt it will soon
      be the same story over and over, and only make one wish&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That there could be a revolution before I am of age.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; cried Primrose, coming up as he spoke. &ldquo;A revolution?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, guillotines and all, to cut off your head in Rotherwood Park,&rdquo; said
      Gerald lightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you don&rsquo;t really mean it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that sort,&rdquo; said Dolores. &ldquo;Only the coming of the coquecigrues.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are in &lsquo;The Water Babies&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Primrose, mystified.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each of those two liked to talk to the other as a sort of fellow-captive,
      solacing themselves with discussions over the &lsquo;Censor&rsquo; and its fellows.
      Love is not often the first thought, even where it lurks in modern
      intellectual intercourse between man and maid; and though Kitty Varley
      might giggle, the others thought the idea only worthy of her. Aunt Jane,
      however, smelt out the notion, and could not but communicate it to her
      sister, though adding&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe in it: Dolores is in love with Physiology, and the boy
      with what Jasper calls Socialist maggots, but not with each other, unless
      they work round in some queer fashion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      However, Lady Merrifield, feeling herself accountable for Dolores, was
      anxious to gather ideas about Gerald from his aunt, with whom she was
      becoming more and more intimate. She was more than twenty years the
      senior, and the thread of connection was very slender, but they suited one
      another so well that they had become Lilias and Geraldine to one another.
      Lady Merrifield had preserved her youthfulness chiefly from having had a
      happy home, unbroken by family sorrows or carking cares, and with a
      husband who had always taken his full share of responsibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your nephew&rsquo;s production has made a stir,&rdquo; said she, when they found
      themselves alone together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, poor boy.&rdquo; Then answering the tone rather than the words, &ldquo;I suppose
      it is the lot of one generation to be startled by the next. There is a
      good deal of change in the outlook.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Lady Merrifield. &ldquo;The young ones, especially the youngest,
      seem to have a set of notions of their own that I cannot always follow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; said Geraldine eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You feel the same? To begin with, the laws of young ladyhood&mdash;maidenliness&mdash;are
      a good deal relaxed&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There I am not much of a judge. I never had any young ladyhood, but I own
      that the few times I went out with Anna I have been surprised, and more
      surprised at what I heard from her sister Emily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What we should have thought simply shocking being tolerated now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so; and we are viewed as old duennas for not liking it. I should
      say, however, that it is not, or has not, been a personal trouble with me.
      Anna&rsquo;s passion is for her Uncle Clement, and she has given up the season
      on his account, though Lady Travis Underwood was most anxious to have her;
      and as to Emily, though she is obliged to go out sometimes, she hates it,
      and has a soul set on slums and nursing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that the style of gaieties revolts a nice-minded girl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Partly. Perhaps such as the Travis Underwoods used to take part in,
      rather against their own likings, poor things, are much less restrained
      for the young people than what would come in your daughters&rsquo; way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps; though Lady Rotherwood has once or twice in country-houses had
      to protect her daughter, to the great disgust of the other young people.
      That is one development that it is hard to meet, for it is difficult to
      know where old-fashioned distaste is the motive, and where the real
      principle of modesty. Though to me the question is made easy, for Sir
      Jasper would never hear of cricket for his daughters, scarcely of hunting,
      and we have taken away Valetta and Primrose from the dancing-classes since
      skirt-dancing has come in; but I fear Val thinks it hard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such things puzzle my sisters at Vale Leston. They are part of the same
      spirit of independence that sends girls to hospitals or medical schools.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or colleges, or lecturing. Dolores is wild to lecture, and I see no harm
      in her trying her wings at the High School on some safe subject, if her
      father in New Zealand does not object, though I am glad it has not
      occurred to any of my own girls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Jasper would not like it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not; but if my brother consents he will not mind it for
      Dolores. She is a good girl in the main, but even mine have very different
      ideals from what we had.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please tell me. I see it a little, and I have been thinking about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, perhaps you will laugh, but my ideal work was Sunday-schools.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are not they Miss Mohun&rsquo;s ideal still?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, infinitely developed, and so they are my cousin Florence&rsquo;s&mdash;Lady
      Florence Devereux; but the young ones think them behind the times. I
      remember when every girl believed her children the prettiest and cleverest
      in nature, showed off her Sunday-school as her pride and treasure, and
      composed small pink books about them, where the catastrophe was either
      being killed by accident, or going to live in the clergyman&rsquo;s nursery.
      Now, those that teach do so simply as a duty and not a romance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the difficulty is to find those who will teach,&rdquo; said Geraldine. &ldquo;One
      thing is, that the children really require better teaching.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is quite true. My girls show me their preparation work, and I see
      much that I should not have thought of teaching the Beechcroft children.
      But all the excitement of the matter has gone off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know. The Vale Leston girls do it as their needful work, not with their
      hearts and enthusiasm. I expect an enthusiasm cannot be expected to last
      above a generation and perhaps a half.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely. A more indifferent thing; you will laugh, but my enthusiasm
      was for chivalry, Christian chivalry, half symbolic. History was
      delightful to me for the search for true knights. I had lists of them,
      drawings if possible, but I never could indoctrinate anybody with my
      affection. Either history is only a lesson, or they know a great deal too
      much, and will prove to you that the Cid was a ruffian, and the Black
      Prince not much better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And are you allowed the &lsquo;Idylls of the King&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Under protest, now that the Mouse-trap has adopted Browning for weekly
      reading and discussion. Tennyson is almost put on the same shelf with
      Scott, whom I love better than ever. Is it progress?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I suppose it is, in a way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But is it the right way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I want to see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now listen. When our young men, my brothers&mdash;especially my very dear
      brother Claude and his contemporaries, Rotherwood is the only one left&mdash;were
      at Oxford, they got raised into a higher atmosphere, and came home with
      beautiful plans and hopes for the Church, and drew us up with them; but
      now the University seems just an ordeal for faith to go through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think there was less of outward temptation, but more of subtle
      trial. And then the whole system has altered since the times you are
      speaking of, when the old rules prevailed, and the great giants of Church
      renewal were there!&rdquo; said Geraldine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You belong to the generation whom they trained, and who are now passing
      away. My father was one who grew up then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We live on their spirit still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so. I never knew much about Cambridge till Clement went there, but
      it had the same influence on him. Indeed, all our home had that one
      thought ever since I can remember. Clement and Lance grew up in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you will forgive me. These younger men either go very, very much
      further than we older ones dreamt of, or they have flaws in their faith,
      and sometimes&mdash;which is the strangest difficulty&mdash;the vehement
      observance and ritual with flaws beneath in their faith perhaps, or their
      loyalty&mdash;Socialist fancies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is impatience,&rdquo; said Geraldine. &ldquo;The Church progress has not
      conquered all the guilt and misery in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who said it would?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None of us; but these younger ones fancy it is the Church&rsquo;s fault,
      instead of that of her members&rsquo; failures, and so they try to walk in the
      light of the sparks that they have kindled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Altruism as they call it&mdash;love of the neighbour without love of
      God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may lead that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps we are the impatient ones now,&rdquo; said Geraldine, &ldquo;in disliking the
      young ones&rsquo; experiments, and wanting to bind them to our own views.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you look on with toleration but with distrust.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Distrust of myself as well as of the young ones, and trying not to forget
      that &lsquo;one good custom may corrupt the world,&rsquo; so it may be as well that
      the pendulum should swing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The pendulum, but not its axis&mdash;faith!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; and of my boy&rsquo;s mainspring of faith I <i>do</i> feel sure, and of his
      real upright steadiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Merrifield asked no more, but could wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      But is not each generation a terra incognita to the last? A question which
      those feel most decidedly who stand on the border-land of both, with love
      and sympathy divided between the old and the new, clinging to the one, and
      fearing to alienate the other.

      Clement Underwood was so much better as to be arrived at taking solitary
      rides and walks, these suiting him better than having companions, as he
      liked to go his own pace, and preferred silence. His sister had become
      much engrossed with her painting, and saw likewise that in this matter of
      exercise it was better to let him go his own way, and he declared that
      this time of thought and reading was an immense help to him, restoring
      that balance of life which he seemed to himself to have lost in the whirl
      of duties at St. Matthew&rsquo;s after Felix&rsquo;s death.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shore, with the fresh, monotonous plash of the waves, when the tide
      served, was his favourite resort. He could stand still and look out over
      the expanse of ripples, or wander on, as he pleased, watching the
      sea-gulls float along&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;As though life&rsquo;s only call and care
             Were graceful motion.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      There had been a somewhat noisy luncheon, for Edward Harewood, a
      midshipman in the Channel Fleet, which was hovering in the offing, had
      come over on a day&rsquo;s leave with Horner, a messmate whose parents lived in
      the town. He was a big lad, a year older than Gerald, and as soon as a
      little awe of Uncle Clement and Aunt Cherry had worn off, he showed
      himself of the original Harewood type, directing himself chiefly to what
      he meant to be teasing Gerald about Vale Leston and Penbeacon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the grouse there were on the bit of moor are snapped up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely,&rdquo; said Gerald coolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those precious surveyors and engineers that Walsh brings down can give an
      account of them! As soon as you come of age, you&rsquo;ll have to double your
      staff of keepers, I can tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guardians of ferae naturae,&rdquo; said Gerald.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought your father did all that was required in that line,&rdquo; said
      Clement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not since duffers and land-lubbers have been marauding over Penbeacon&mdash;aye,
      and elsewhere. What would you say to an engineer poaching away one of the
      august house of Vanderkist?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The awful cad! I&rsquo;d soon show him what I thought of his cheek,&rdquo; cried
      Adrian, with a flourish of his knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, ha! I bet that he will be shooting over Ironbeam Park long before you
      are of age.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall shoot him, then,&rdquo; cried Adrian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not improbably there will be nothing else to shoot by that time,&rdquo; quietly
      said Gerald.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall have a keeper in every lodge, and bring up four or five hundred
      pheasants every year,&rdquo; boasted the little baronet, quite alive to the
      pride of possession, though he had never seen Ironbeam in his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward laughed a &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you wish you may get it,&rdquo; and the others, who knew
      very well the futility of the poor boy&rsquo;s expectations, even if Gerald&rsquo;s
      augury were not fulfilled, hastened to turn away the conversation to plans
      for the afternoon. Anna asked the visitor if he would ride out with her
      and Gerald to Clipstone or to the moor, and was relieved when he declined,
      saying he had promised to meet Horner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will come in to tea at five?&rdquo; said his aunt, &ldquo;and bring him if you
      like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks awfully, but we hardly can. We have to start from the quay at six
      sharp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All had gone their several ways, and Clement, after the heat of the day,
      was pacing towards a secluded cove out of an inner bay which lay nearer
      than Anscombe Cove, but was not much frequented. However, he smelt
      tobacco, and heard sounds of boyish glee, and presently saw Adrian and
      Fergus Merrifield, bare-legged, digging in the mud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! youngsters! Do you know the tide has turned? I thought you had had
      enough of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I might find my aralia!&rdquo; sighed Fergus. &ldquo;The tide was almost as
      low.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then there resounded from behind a projecting rock a peal of
      undesirable singing, a shout of laughter, and an oath, with&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Holloa, those little beasts of teetotallers have hooked it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There were confused cries&mdash;&ldquo;Haul &lsquo;em back! Drench &lsquo;em. Give &lsquo;em a
      roll in the mud!&rdquo; and Adrian shrank behind his uncle, taking hold of his
      coat, as there burst from behind the rock a party of boys, headed by the
      two cadets, all shouting loudly, till brought to a sudden standstill by
      the sight of &ldquo;Parson! By Jove!&rdquo; as the Horner mid muttered, taking out his
      pipe, while Edward Harewood mumbled something about &ldquo;Horner&rsquo;s brother&rsquo;s
      tuck-out.&rdquo; One or two other boys were picking up the remains of the feast,
      which had been on lobsters, jam tarts, clotted cream, and the like
      delicacies dear to the juvenile mind. The two biggest school-boys came
      forward, one voluble and thick of speech about Horner&rsquo;s tuck-out, and &ldquo;I
      assure you, sir, it is nothing&mdash;not a taste. Never thought of such&mdash;&rdquo;
       Just then the other lad, staggering about, had almost lurched over into
      the deepening channel; but Clement caught him by the collar and held him
      fast, demanding in a low voice, very terrible to his hearers&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where does this poor boy live?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Adrian who answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Devereux Buildings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You two, Adrian and Fergus, run to the quay and fetch a cab as near this
      place as it can come,&rdquo; said Clement. &ldquo;You little fellows, you had better
      run home at once. I hope you will take warning by the shame and disgrace
      of this spectacle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boys were glad enough to disperse, being terrified by the condition of
      the prisoner, as well as by the detection; but the two who were encumbered
      with the baskets containing the bottles, jam-pots, and tin of cream
      remained, and so did the two young sailors, Horner saying civilly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll not be hard on the kids, sir, for just a spree carried a little
      too far.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I certainly shall not be hard on the children, whom you seem to have
      tempted,&rdquo; was the answer as they moved along; and as the younger Horner
      turned towards a little shop near the end of the steps to restore the
      goods, he asked&mdash;&ldquo;Were you supplied from hence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Horner, who was perhaps hardly sober enough for caution.
      &ldquo;Mother Butterfly is a jolly old soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Looking up. Clement saw no licence to sell spirituous liquors under the
      name of Sarah Schnetterling, tobacconist. The window had the placard &lsquo;Ici
      on parle Francais&rsquo;, and was adorned in a tasteful manner with ornamental
      pipes, fishing-rods and flies, jars of sweets, sheets of foreign stamps,
      pictorial advertisements of innocuous beverages. A woman with black
      grizzling hair, fashionably dressed, flashing dark eyes, long gold
      ear-rings, gold beads and gaudy attire, came out to reclaim her property.
      A word or two passed about payment, during which Clement had a strange
      thrill of puzzled recollection. The bottles bore the labels of raspberry
      vinegar and lemonade, but he had seen too much not to say&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You drive a dangerous trade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, sir, young people will be gourmands,&rdquo; she said, with a foreign
      accent. &ldquo;Ah, that poor young gentleman is very ill. Will he not come in
      and lie down to recover?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; said Clement. &ldquo;A carriage is coming to take him home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Something about the fat in the fire was passing between the cadets, and
      the younger of them began to repeat that he had come for his brother&rsquo;s
      birthday, and that he feared they had brought the youngsters into a scrape
      by carrying the joke too far.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have nothing to say to you, sir,&rdquo; said the Vicar of St. Matthew&rsquo;s,
      looking very majestic, &ldquo;except that it is time you were returning to your
      ship. As to you,&rdquo; turning to Edward Harewood, &ldquo;I can only say that if you
      are aware of the peculiar circumstances of Adrian Vanderkist, your conduct
      can only be called fiendish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fergus and Adrian came running up with tidings that the cab was waiting.
      Edward Harewood stood sullen, but the other lad said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unlucky. We are sorry to have got the little fellows into trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held out his hand, and Clement did not refuse it, as he did that of his
      own nephew. Still, there was a certain satisfaction at his heart as he
      beheld the clear, honest young faces of the other two boys, and he bade
      Adrian run home and wait for him, saying to Fergus&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to have been a good friend to my little nephew. Thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fergus coloured up, speechless between pleasure at the warm tone of
      commendation and the obligations of school-boy honour, nor, with young
      Campbell on their hands, was there space for questions. That youth
      subsided into a heavy doze in the cab, and so continued till the arrival
      at No. 7, Devereux Buildings, where a capable-looking maid-servant opened
      the door, and he was deposited into her hands, the Vicar leaving his card
      with his present address, but feeling equal to nothing more, and hardly
      able to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drove home, finding his nephew in the doorway. Signing to the maid to
      pay the driver, and to the boy to follow him, he reached his study, and
      sank into his easy-chair, Adrian opening frightened eyes and saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call Sibby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;that bottle&mdash;drop to there,&rdquo; signing to the mark on the
      glass with his nail.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a pause, while he held fast the boy, so to speak, with his eyes, he
      said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, dear lad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Clement,&rdquo; said Adrian then, &ldquo;we weren&rsquo;t doing anything. Merrifield
      thought his old bit of auralia, or whatever he calls it, was there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw&mdash;I saw, my boy. To find you&mdash;as you were, made me most
      thankful. You must have resisted. Tell me, were you of this party, or did
      you come on them by accident?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Horner asked me,&rdquo; said Adrian, twisting from one leg to another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clement saw the crisis was come which he had long expected, and rejoiced
      at the form it had taken, though he knew he should suffer from pursuing
      the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adrian,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am much pleased with you. I don&rsquo;t want to get you
      into a row, but I should be much obliged if you would tell me how all this
      happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; returned Adrian, &ldquo;but for that Ted and the other chap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean that there would have been none of this&mdash;drinking&mdash;but
      for them? Don&rsquo;t be afraid to tell me all. Was the stuff all got from that
      Mrs. Schnetter&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother Butterfly&rsquo;s? Oh yes. She keeps bottles of grog with those labels,
      and it is such a lark for her to be even with the gangers that our fellows
      generally get some after cricket, or for a tuck-out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not Fergus Merrifield?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no; he&rsquo;s captain, you know, but he is two years younger than Campbell
      and Horner, and they can&rsquo;t bear him, and when he made a jaw about it&mdash;he
      can jaw awfully, you know&mdash;and he is stuck up, and Horner major swore
      he would make him know his bearings&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder he was there at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Horner asked him, and he can&rsquo;t get those fossils that were lost out
      of his head, and he thought they might be washed up. He said too, he knew
      they would be up to something if he wasn&rsquo;t there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Clement, with an odd recollection, &ldquo;but I suppose he did not
      know about these cadets?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, the big Horner sent up to Mother Butterfly&rsquo;s for some more stuff, not
      so mild, and then Ted set upon me, and said it was all because of me that
      Vale Leston had to live like a boiling of teetotal frogs and toads, just
      to please the little baronet&rsquo;s lady mamma, but I was a Dutchman all the
      same, and should sell them yet&mdash;I sucked it in so well, and they
      talked of seeing how much I could stand. Something about my governor, and
      here&mdash;that word in the Catechism.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; gasped Clement, fairly clutching his arm, &ldquo;and what spared you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Horner came down, and Sweetie Bob, that&rsquo;s the errand-boy, and there was a
      bother about the money, for Bob wasn&rsquo;t to leave anything without being
      paid, and while they were jawing about that, Merry laid hold of me and
      said, &lsquo;Come and look for the aralia.&rsquo; They got to shouting and singing,
      and I don&rsquo;t think they saw what was doing. They were nasty songs, and
      Merry touched me and said, &lsquo;Let us go after the aralia.&rsquo; We got away
      without their missing us at first, but they ran after us when they found
      it out, and if you had not been there, Uncle Clem&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God I was! Now, Adrian, first tell me, did you taste this stuff?
      You said you sucked it in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I did, a little. You know, uncle, one cannot always be made a baby.
      Women don&rsquo;t understand, you know, and don&rsquo;t know what a fool it makes a
      man to have them always after him, and have everything put out of his way
      like a precious infant, and people drinking it on the sly like Gerald, or&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or me, eh, Adrian? I can tell you that I never tasted it for thirty
      years, and now only as a medicine. Lance, never.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they did not treat you like a baby, and never let you see so much as
      a glass of beer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I am going to treat you like a man, but it is a sorrowful history
      that I have to tell you. You know that your mother and Aunt Wilmet are
      twin sisters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, though Aunt Wilmet is stout and jolly, and mother ever so much
      prettier and more delicate and nice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, from ill-health. She is never free from suffering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know. Old Dr. May said there was no help for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what caused that ill-health? My boy, they spoke of your
      father to-day&mdash;brutes that they were,&rdquo; he could not help muttering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he died when I was a week old.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had ruined himself when quite a young man, body, soul, and estate&mdash;and
      you too, beforehand, in estate, and broken your mother&rsquo;s heart and health
      by being given up to that miserable habit from which we want to save you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought it was only poor men that got drunk and beat their wives&rdquo; (more
      knowledge, by the bye, than he was supposed to possess). &ldquo;He did not beat
      her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no, no,&rdquo; said Clement, &ldquo;but he as surely destroyed all her happiness,
      and made you and your sisters very poor for your station in life, so that
      it is really hard to educate you, and you will have to work for yourself
      and them. And at only thirty-six years old his life was cut off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was that what D. T. meant? I heard Ted whisper something about that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was well,&rdquo; thought Clement, &ldquo;that he had grace enough to whisper. Yes,
      my poor boy, it is only too true. I was sent for to find your father dying
      of delirium tremens&mdash;you just born, your mother nearly dead, the
      desolation of your sisters unspeakable. He was only thirty-six, and that
      vice, together with racing, had devoured him and all the property that
      should have come to his children. I think he tried to repent at the very
      last, but there was little time, little power, only he put you and your
      sisters in my charge, and begged me to save you from being like him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did they mean that I was sure to be like that? Like a pointer puppy,
      pointing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They meant it. And, Adrian, it is so far true that there is an
      inheritance&mdash;with some more, with some less&mdash;of our forefathers&rsquo; 
      nature. Some have tendencies harder to repress than others. But, my dear
      boy, you know that we all have had a force given us wherewith to repress
      and conquer those tendencies, and that we can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When we were baptized, God the Holy Spirit,&rdquo; said Adrian, under his
      breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know it, you can believe now. Your uncle Lance and I prayed that the
      old nature might be put down, the new raised up. We pray, your mother and
      sisters have prayed ever since, that so it may be, that you may conquer
      any evil tendencies that may be in you; but, Adrian, no one can save you
      from the outside if you do not strive yourself. Now you see why your poor
      mother has been so anxious to keep all temptation out of your reach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m growing a man now. I can&rsquo;t always go on so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you can&rsquo;t. You shall be treated as a man while you are with me. But I
      do very seriously advise you&mdash;nay, I entreat of you, not to begin
      taking any kind of liquor, for it would incite the taste to grow upon you,
      till it might become uncontrollable, and be your tyrant. If you have
      reason to think the pledge would be a protection to you, come to me, or to
      Uncle Bill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was interrupted by Sibby coming in with his cup of tea, and&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Mr. Clement, whatever have you been after now? Up to your antics the
      minute Miss Cherry is out of the way. Aye, ye needn&rsquo;t go to palavering me.
      I hear it in your breath,&rdquo; and she darted at the stimulant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had some, Sibby, since I came in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More reason you should have it now. Get off with you, Sir Adrian, don&rsquo;t
      be worriting him. Now, drink that, sir, and don&rsquo;t speak another word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was glad to obey. He wanted to think, in much thankfulness for the
      present, and in faith and love which brought hope for the future.

      CHAPTER XV. &mdash; A POOR FOREIGN WIDOW
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Art thou a magistrate?  Then be severe.&mdash;GEORGE HERBERT.
</pre>
    <p>
      Early in the day General Mohun received a note from Clement Underwood,
      begging him to look in at St. Andrew&rsquo;s Rock as soon as might be
      convenient.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said his sister, &ldquo;I strongly suspect something wrong about the boys.
      Fergus was very odd and silent last night when I asked him about Jem
      Horner&rsquo;s picnic, and he said something about that Harewood cousin being an
      unmitigated brute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope Fergus was not in a scrape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no, it is not his way. His geology is a great safeguard. If it had
      been Wilfred I might have been afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His head is full&mdash;at least as much room as the lost aralia leaves&mdash;of
      the examination for the Winchester College election.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you know Jasper has actually promised Gillian that if either of her
      brothers gets a scholarship, she may be allowed a year at Lady Margaret
      Hall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it incited her to worry Wilfred beyond sufferance in his holidays. I
      know if you or Lily had been always at me I should have kicked as hard as
      he does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lily herself can hardly cram him with his holiday task; but Fergus is a
      good little fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have kept him at it in a more judgmatical way. But won&rsquo;t Armytage
      come in between the damsel and her college?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Mr. Armytage&mdash;Captain, I believe, for he has got his
      commandership. Gill snubs him desperately. I believe she is afraid of
      herself and her heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope she won&rsquo;t be a goose. Jasper told me that he is an excellent
      fellow, and it will be an absolute misfortune if the girl is besotted
      enough to refuse him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Girls have set up a foolish prejudice against matrimony.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I am off. Clement Underwood is a reasonable man, and would not send
      for me without cause.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      General Mohun came to that opinion when he heard of the scene on the
      beach, and of the absolute certainty that the contraband goods had been
      procured at Mrs. Schnetterling&rsquo;s. Before his visit was over, a note came
      down on gold-edged, cyphered pink paper, informing the Reverend E. C.
      Underwood that Mrs. Campbell was much obliged to him for his attention to
      her son, who was very unwell, entirely from the effects of clotted cream.
      And while they were still laughing over the scored words, Anna knocked at
      the door with a message from her aunt, to ask whether they could come and
      speak to poor Mrs. Edgar, who was in a dreadful state.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not about Adrian, I hope?&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no, no, my dear; Adrian is all right, thanks to Fergus again,&rdquo; said
      her uncle. &ldquo;He is the boy&rsquo;s great protector; I only wish they could be
      always together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor Mrs. Edgar! Rumours had not been slow in reaching her of the
      condition in which her scholars had been found, very odd rumours too. One
      that James Campbell had been brought home insensible, and the two sailors
      carried on board in the like state; and an opposite report, that the poor
      dear boys had only made themselves sick with dainties out of Mrs.
      Schnetterling&rsquo;s, and it was all a cruel notion of that teetotal ritualist
      clergyman. Some boys would not speak, others were vague and contradictory,
      and many knew nothing, Horner and Campbell were absent. Clement much
      relieved her by giving an account of the matter, and declaring that he
      feared his own elder nephew was the cause of all the scandal, though he
      believed that some of her bigger pupils were guilty of obtaining a smaller
      quantity, knowingly, of the Schnetterling&rsquo;s illicit wares, chiefly so far
      for the fun of doing something forbidden&mdash;&ldquo;Stolen waters are sweet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A wicked woman! Surely she should not be allowed to go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going, on the spot, to see what can be done,&rdquo; said General Mohun;
      &ldquo;but indeed I should have thought young Campbell rather too old for your
      precincts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! yes. He is troublesome, but he is so backward, and is so delicate,
      that his mother has implored me to keep him on, that he may have
      sea-bathing. But this shall be the final stroke!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be the ruin of your school otherwise,&rdquo; said the General.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! it might. And yet Mrs. Campbell will never be persuaded of the fact!
      And she is a person of much influence! However, I cannot have my poor dear
      little fellows led astray.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, with some decided praises of dear little Sir Adrian, and regrets at
      losing Fergus Merrifield, whom she declared, on the authority of her
      gentleman assistant, to be certain of success, she departed; and Clement
      resumed his task of writing letters, which he believed to be useless, but
      which he felt to be right&mdash;one a grave warning to Edward Harewood,
      and one to his father, whose indulgence he could not but hold accountable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reginald Mohun meanwhile went his way to the officer of Inland Revenue,
      who already had his suspicions as to Mrs. Schnetterling, and was glad of
      positive evidence. He returned with the General to hear from Mr. Underwood
      the condition in which he had found the boys, and the cause he had for
      attributing it to the supplies from Mother Butterfly, and this was thought
      sufficient evidence to authorize the sending a constable with a
      search-warrant to the shop. The two gentlemen were glad that the detection
      should be possible without either sending a spy, or forcing evidence from
      the boys, who had much better be kept out of the matter altogether. No
      lack of illicit stores was found when the policemen made their descent,
      and a summons was accordingly served on its mistress to appear at the next
      Petty Sessions.
    </p>

      Reginald Mohun, used to the justice of county magistrates, and the
      unflinching dealings of courts-martial, was determined to see the affair
      through, so he went to the magistrates&rsquo; meeting, and returned with the
      tidings that the possession of smuggled tobacco ready for sale had been
      proved against Mrs. Schnetterling, and she had been fined twenty-five
      pounds, to be paid at the next Petty Sessions. Otherwise goods would be
      seized to that value, or she would have a short term of imprisonment.
      There was no doubt that contraband spirits were also found, but it was not
      thought expedient to press this charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said the poor woman had been in a great passion of despair, wringing
      her hands and weeping demonstratively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite theatrical,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am sure she has been an actress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It did not prejudice your hard-headed town-councillors in her favour,&rdquo;
       said Gerald.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Far from it! In fact old Simmonds observed that she was a painted foreign
      Jezebel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to her face!&rdquo; said Gerald.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are not quite brutes, whatever you may think us, my boy,&rdquo; said the
      General good-humouredly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Gerald, in the same tone, &ldquo;how could I tell how it might be
      when the Philistines conspired to hunt down a poor foreign widow trying to
      pick up a scanty livelihood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the poor foreign widow had been content without corrupting the boys,&rdquo;
       said Clement, &ldquo;she would have been let alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was not for corrupting the boys. That was done&mdash;or not done&mdash;by
      my amiable cousin Ted. What harm did her &lsquo;baccy do to living soul?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a risky thing, to say the least of it, for a living soul to defraud
      the revenue,&rdquo; said Clement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of which probably she never heard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She must have seen the terms of her licence,&rdquo; said the General.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, a way of increasing the revenue by burthens on the chief solace of
      poverty,&rdquo; said Gerald hotly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll come to your senses by and by, young man,&rdquo; imperturbably answered
      the General.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she likely to be able to pay?&rdquo; asked Gerald in return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, the policeman said she drove a very thriving trade, both with the
      boys and with the sailors, and that there was no doubt that she could
      pay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clement was very glad to hear it, for it not only obviated any sense of
      harshness in his mind, but he thought Gerald, in his present mood of
      compassion&mdash;or opposition, whichever it was&mdash;capable of offering
      to undertake to pay the fine for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor little Ludmilla was found the next day by Mrs. Henderson, crying
      softly over her work at the mosaic department&mdash;work which was only
      the mechanical arrangement from patterns provided, for she had no
      originality, and would never attain to any promotion in the profession.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Henderson took the poor girl to her own little office, to try to
      comfort her, and bring her into condition for the rehearsal of the scene
      with Ferdinand, which she was to go through in Mr. Flight&rsquo;s parlour
      chaperoned by his mother. She was so choked with sobs that it did not seem
      probable that she would have any voice; for she had been struggling with
      her tears all day, and now, in the presence of her friend, she gave them a
      free course. She thought it so cruel&mdash;so very cruel of the gentlemen;
      how could they do such a thing to a poor helpless stranger? And that tall
      one&mdash;to be a clergyman&mdash;how could he?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Henderson tried to represent that, having accepted the licence on
      certain terms, it was wrong to break them; and that the gentlemen must be
      right to hinder harm to their nephews.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed all past the poor girl&rsquo;s understanding, since the nephews had
      taken no harm; and indeed the other boys had only touched the spirits by
      way of joke and doing something forbidden: it had all come of those horrid
      young midshipmen, who had come down and worried and bothered her mother
      into giving them the bottles of spirits which had not been mixed. It was
      very hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Lydia, one sin leads no one knows where! Those little boys, think of
      their first learning the taste for alcohol in secret!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lydia did see this, but after all, she said, it was not the spirits, but
      the tobacco, which the Dutch and American sailors were glad enough to
      exchange for her mother&rsquo;s commodities. She had never perceived any harm in
      the arrangement, and hardly comprehended when the saying, &ldquo;Custom to whom
      custom,&rdquo; was pointed out to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kalliope asked whether the fine would fall heavily on her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that is worst of all. Mother is gone to Avoncester to raise the
      money. She won&rsquo;t tell me how. And I do believe O&rsquo;Leary&rsquo;s circus is there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then came another sobbing fit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how&mdash;what do you mean, my dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O&rsquo;Leary was our clown when my father&mdash;my dear father&mdash;was
      alive. He was a coarse horrid man, as cruel to the poor dear horses as he
      dared. And now he has set up for himself, and has been going about all
      over the county. Mother has been quite different ever since she met him
      one day in Avoncester, and I fear&mdash;oh, I fear he will advance her
      this money, and make her give me up to him; and my dear father made her
      promise that I would never be on the boards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was in an agony of crying, and it appeared that Schnetterling had
      really been a very decent, amiable person, who had been passionately fond
      of his little daughter. Her recollection dated from the time when the
      family had come from America, and he had become partner in a circus,
      intending to collect means enough to retire to a home in Germany, but he
      had died five years ago, at Avoncester, of fever, and his wife had used
      his savings to set up this little shop at Rockquay, choosing that place
      because it was the resort of foreign trading-vessels, with whom her
      knowledge of languages would be available. She had suffered from the same
      illness, and her voice had been affected at the time, and she was
      altogether subdued and altered, and had allowed her daughter to receive a
      good National school training; but with the recovery of health, activity,
      and voice, a new temper, or rather the old one renewed, had seized her,
      and since she had met her former companion, Ludmilla foreboded that the
      impulse of wandering had come upon her, and that if the interference of
      the authorities pressed upon her and endangered her traffic, she would
      throw it up altogether, and drag her daughter into the profession so
      dreadful to all the poor child&rsquo;s feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      No wonder that the girl cried till she had no voice, and took but partial
      comfort from repeated assurances that her friends would do their utmost on
      her behalf. Mrs. Henderson tried to compose and cheer her, walking with
      her herself to St. Kenelm&rsquo;s Parsonage, and trying to keep up her earnest
      desire to please Mr. Flight, the special object of her veneration. But
      wishes were ineffectual to prevent her from breaking down in the first
      line of her first song, and when Mr. Flight blamed, and Lady Flight turned
      round on the music-stool to say severely&mdash;&ldquo;Command yourself, Lydia,&rdquo;
       she became almost hysterical.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; said Gerald. &ldquo;Give her a glass of wine, and she will be
      better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no, no; please, I&rsquo;m temp&mdash;&rdquo; and a sob.
    </p>
    <p>
      The five o&rsquo;clock tea was still standing on a little table, and Gerald
      poured out a cup and took it to her, then set her down in an arm-chair,
      and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go through Angus&rsquo; part, and she will be better,&rdquo; and as she tried to
      say &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; and &ldquo;So kind,&rdquo; he held up his hand, and told her to be
      silent. In fact, his encouragement, and the little delay he had made,
      enabled her to recover herself enough to get through her part, though
      nothing like as well as would have been expected of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said Gerald, &ldquo;she will be all right when my uncle comes.
      Won&rsquo;t you, Mona?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have expected&mdash;&rdquo; began Lady Flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gerald held up his hand in entreaty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People&rsquo;s voices can&rsquo;t be always the same,&rdquo; he said cheerily. &ldquo;I know our
      Mona will do us credit yet! Won&rsquo;t you, Mona? You know how to pity me with
      my logs!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better go and have some tea in the kitchen, Lydia,&rdquo; said Lady
      Flight repressively; and Ludmilla curtsied herself off, with a look of
      gratitude out of her swollen eyelids at Gerald.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor little mortal,&rdquo; he said, as she went. &ldquo;I am afraid that in her case
      summum jus was summa injuria.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was quite right to prosecute that mischievous woman,&rdquo; said Mr. Flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; said Gerald; &ldquo;but wheat will grow alongside of tares.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope the girl is wheat,&rdquo; half ironically and severely said the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gerald shrugged his shoulders and took his leave.

      CHAPTER XVI. &mdash; &ldquo;SEE, THE CONQUERING HERO COMES&rdquo;
     </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     And with trumpets and with banners
     As becomes gintale good manners.&mdash;THACKERAY.
</pre>
    <p>
      A telegram from Sir Jasper brought the good news that Fergus&rsquo;s name was
      high on the Winchester roll, and that he was sure of entering college
      after the holidays. Gillian alone was allowed to go up to the station with
      her uncle Reginald to meet the travellers, lest the whole family should be
      too demonstrative in their welcome. And at the same time there emerged
      from the train not only Captain Armytage, but also Lancelot Underwood and
      his little boy. All the rest of his family were gone to Stoneborough to
      delight the hearts of Dr. May and his daughter Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gillian was in such training that she durst not embrace her brother when
      he tumbled out of the carriage, though she could hardly keep her feet from
      dancing, but she only demurely said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma and all of them are at Aunt Jane&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come then,&rdquo; said Sir Jasper to Captain Armytage, for which Gillian was
      not grateful, or thought herself not, for she made a wry face.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a good deal of luggage&mdash;theatrical appliances to be sent to
      the pavilion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This may as well go too,&rdquo; said Captain Armytage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! oh! It is the buccaneer&rsquo;s sword!&rdquo; cried little Felix. &ldquo;How lovely!
      Last time we only had Uncle Jack&rsquo;s, and this is ever so much longer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do let me draw it!&rdquo; cried Fergus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not here, my boy, or they would think a conspiracy was breaking out. Ha!&rdquo;
       as a sudden blare of trumpets broke out as they reached the station gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, is it for him?&rdquo; cried Felix, who had been instructed in Fergus&rsquo;s
      triumph.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
         &ldquo;See, the conquering hero comes,
          Sound the trumpets, beat the drums!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      said the General.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fergus actually coloured crimson, but the colour was deepened as he
      muttered &ldquo;Bosh!&rdquo; while two piebald ponies, drawing the drummers and
      trumpeters in fantastic raiment, preceded an elephant shrouded in scarlet
      and gold trappings, with two or three figures making contortions on his
      back, and followed by a crowned and sceptred dame in blue, white, and
      gold, perched aloft on a car drawn by four steeds in glittering
      caparisons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you mount it, Fergus?&rdquo; asked his uncle. &ldquo;You did not expect such a
      demonstration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fergus bit his lip. It was hard to be teased instead of exalted; but Fely
      and he were absorbed in the pink broadsides that the lady in the car was
      scattering.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
            CIRCUS&mdash;THIS NIGHT&mdash;ROTHERWOOD PARK.

</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, daddy! daddy! do take me to see it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, I should like to see it very much indeed,&rdquo; were the exclamations
      of the two little boys. &ldquo;You know I have never seen any acrobatic feats.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A long word enough to please you,&rdquo; said Uncle Reginald. &ldquo;He deserves
      something. I&rsquo;ll take you, master.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think this was not of the first quality,&rdquo; said Sir Jasper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind. Novelty is the charm that one can have only once in one&rsquo;s
      life,&rdquo; said the General.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some of those van fellows are very decent folk,&rdquo; said Lancelot. &ldquo;I have
      seen a great deal of them at Bexley Fair times. You would be astonished to
      know how grateful they are for a little treatment as if they were not out
      of humanity&rsquo;s reach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gillian was trying to make Fergus tell her what his questions had been,
      and how he had answered them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I declare, Gill, you are as bad as some of the boys&rsquo; horrid governors.
      There was one whose father walked him up and down and wouldn&rsquo;t let him
      play cricket, and went over all the old questions with him. I should never
      have got in, if papa hadn&rsquo;t had more sense than to badger me out of my
      life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the gate between the copper beeches the Underwoods and Merrifields
      parted, with an engagement to meet at the circus on the part of the boys
      and their conductors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fergus was greeted with open-mouthed, open-armed delight by all the
      assembled multitude, very little checked by the presence of Captain
      Armytage. Only Lady Merrifield did not say much, but there was a dew in
      her eyes as she held fast the little active fingers, and whispered&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My good industrious boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Jasper, in his grand and gracious manner, turned to his sister-in-law,
      saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We could not but come first to you, Jane, for it is to you that he is
      indebted, as we all are, primarily for his success.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the greatest compliment I ever had, Jasper,&rdquo; she answered,
      smiling but almost tearful, and laughing it off. &ldquo;I feel ready to mount
      yonder elephant lady&rsquo;s triumphal car.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General refrained from any more teasing of Fergus on his first
      impression; and at seven that evening the younger Merrifield boys with
      their uncle, and the two from St. Andrew&rsquo;s Rock with Lance, set off in
      high spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      They re-appeared much sooner than they were expected at Beechcroft
      Cottage, where the Underwoods were spending the long twilight evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A low concern!&rdquo; was the General&rsquo;s verdict.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We fled simultaneously from the concluding ballet,&rdquo; said Lance. &ldquo;There
      had been quite as much as we could bear for ingenuous youth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We stood the Sepoy&rsquo;s Death Song,&rdquo; said the General, &ldquo;but the poster of
      the Bleeding Bride was enough for us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They had only one elephant!&rdquo; cried Adrian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A regular swindle,&rdquo; said Wilfred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No lions!&rdquo; added Fely, &ldquo;nothing to see but that poor old elephant! I wish
      he would have turned round and spouted water at them, as that one did to
      the tailor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Water would be uncommonly good for them,&rdquo; said the General, laughing,
      &ldquo;they are not much acquainted therewith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And such an atmosphere!&rdquo; said Lance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see it on your forehead, poor boy,&rdquo; said Geraldine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to set on the Society against cruelty to animals,&rdquo; said the
      General; &ldquo;I saw galls on the horses&rsquo; necks, and they were all half
      starved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then to see the poor old elephant pretend to be drunk!&rdquo; added Fergus,
      &ldquo;stagger about, and led off by the policeman, drunk and disorderly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was that being drunk?&rdquo; asked Adrian, with wide-open eyes. &ldquo;It was like
      Campbell that day.&rdquo; Everybody laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilfred did so now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You green kid, you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Happy verdure,&rdquo; said the General, &ldquo;to be unaware that some people can
      laugh when they ought to weep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Weep!&rdquo; exclaimed Wilfred, &ldquo;every time one sees a fellow screwy in the
      street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps the angels do,&rdquo; murmured Clement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Master Wilfred, you have expressed your opinions sufficiently
      to-night,&rdquo; said the General. &ldquo;Suppose you and Fergus walk home together. A
      nasty low place as ever I saw. I have a mind to tell the Mayor about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gerald said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is not that making yourself very unpopular?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is no great matter,&rdquo; said the General, rather surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have thought it better to refine the people&rsquo;s tastes than to
      thwart their present ones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The improper must be stopped before the taste for the proper can be
      promoted,&rdquo; said Clement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With all the opposition and ill-blood that you cause?&rdquo; said Gerald. &ldquo;Why,
      if I were an errand-boy, the suppression would send me direct to the
      circus. Would it not do the same by you, Uncle Lance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Discouragement might, prohibition would prevent wholly, and I should be
      thankful,&rdquo; said Lance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you are of the old loyal nature,&rdquo; said Gerald. &ldquo;You of the old school
      can never see things by modern lights.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am thankful to say&mdash;not,&rdquo; responded Reginald Mohun, in a tone that
      made some laugh, and Gerald sigh in Anna&rsquo;s ear&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Happy those who see only one side of a question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was another great day for the boys, namely, the speech or closing
      day at the school, when Fergus was the undoubted hero, and was so exalted
      that his parents thought it would be very bad for him, and were chiefly
      consoled by his strong and genuine dislike to having to declaim with
      Clement Varley the quarrel of Brutus and Cassius. He insisted on always
      calling the former &ldquo;Old Brute,&rdquo; and all the efforts of mother and aunt
      never got him beyond the dogged repetition of a lesson learnt by heart,
      whereas little Varley threw himself into the part with spirit that gained
      all the applause. Fergus carried off a pile of prizes too, but despised
      them. &ldquo;Stupid old poetry!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;what should I do with that? Do let me
      change it, father, for the Handbook of Paleontology, or something worth
      having.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Adrian had three prizes too, filling Anna with infinite delight. He was
      not to go home immediately on the break-up of the school, but was to wait
      for his sisters, who were coming in a few days more with Lady Travis
      Underwood to the bazaar and masque, so that he would go home with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither the prospect nor the company of little Fely greatly reconciled him
      to the delay, but his mother could not believe that her darling could
      travel alone, and his only satisfaction was in helping Fergus to arrange
      his spare specimens for sale.

      CHAPTER XVII. &mdash; EXCLUDED
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   But I needn&rsquo;t tell you what to do, only do it out of hand,
   And charge whatever you like to charge, my lady won&rsquo;t make a stand.
                                                        &mdash;T. HOOD.
</pre>
    <p>
      The ladies&rsquo; committee could not but meet over and over again, wandering
      about the gardens, which were now trimmed into order, to place the stalls
      and decide on what should and should not be.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was to be an art stall, over which Mrs. Henderson was to preside.
      Here were to be the very graceful and beautiful articles of sculpture and
      Italian bijouterie that the Whites had sent home, and that were spared
      from the marble works; also Mrs. Grinstead&rsquo;s drawings, Captain
      Henderson&rsquo;s, those of others, screens and scrap-books and photographs.
      Jasper and a coadjutor or two undertook to photograph any one who wished
      it; and there too were displayed the Mouse-traps. Mrs. Henderson, sure to
      look beautiful, quite Madonna-like in her costume, would have the charge
      of the stall, with Gillian and two other girls, in Italian
      peasant-dresses, sent home by Aunt Ada.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gillian was resolved on standing by her. &ldquo;Kalliope wants some one to give
      her courage,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Besides, I am the mother of the Mouse-trap, and I
      must see how it goes off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Flight and a bevy of young ladies of her selection were to preside
      over the flowers; Mrs. Yarley undertook the refreshments; Lady Merrifield
      the more ordinary bazaar stall. Her name was prized, and Anna was glad to
      shelter herself under her wing. The care of Valetta and Primrose, to say
      nothing of Dolores, was enough inducement to overcome any reluctance, and
      she was glad to be on the committee when vexed questions came on, such as
      Miss Pettifer&rsquo;s offer of a skirt-dance, which could not be so summarily
      dismissed as it had been at Beechcroft, for Lady Flight and Mrs. Varley
      wished for it, and even Mrs. Harper was ready to endure anything to raise
      the much-needed money, and almost thought Lady Merrifield too particular
      when she discontinued the dancing-class for Valetta and Primrose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That speaks for itself,&rdquo; said Mrs. Grinstead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can fancy seeing no harm in it for little girls,&rdquo; said Lady Merrifield,
      &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t like giving them a talent the use of which seems to be to
      enable them to show off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I know that Lady Rotherwood would not approve,&rdquo; said Miss Mohun,
      aware that this settled the matter. &ldquo;And here&rsquo;s another outsider, Miss
      Penfeather, who offers to interpret handwriting at two-and-sixpence a
      head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By all means,&rdquo; was the cry. &ldquo;We will build her a bower somewhere near the
      photography.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am only afraid,&rdquo; added Jane, &ldquo;of her offering to do palmistry. Do you
      know, I dabbled a little in that once, and I came to the conclusion that
      it was not a safe study for oneself or any one else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right,&rdquo; said Geraldine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you believe in it then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so as to practise it, or accept it so far as the future is concerned,
      and to play at it as a parody of fortune-telling seems to me utterly
      inadmissible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to be squashed with Lord Rotherwood&rsquo;s mighty name,&rdquo; said her sister,
      laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Rotherwood would do so effectively. Wherewith came on the question of
      raffles, an inexhaustible one, since some maintained that they were
      contrary to English law, and were absolutely immoral, while others held
      that it was the only way of disposing of really expensive articles. These
      were two statues sent by Mrs. White, and an exquisite little picture by
      Mrs. Grinstead, worth more than any one could be expected to give. It was
      one that she had nearly finished at the time of Mr. Grinstead&rsquo;s illness&mdash;John
      Inglesant arriving in his armour of light on his wedding morning&mdash;and
      the associations were so painful that she said she never wished to see it
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were likewise a good many charming sketches of figures and scenery,
      over which Gerald and Anna grieved, though she had let them keep all they
      could show cause for; but drawing had become as much her resource as in
      the good old days. She was always throwing off little outlines, and she
      had even begun a grand study, which she called &ldquo;Safe Home,&rdquo; a vessel
      showing signs of storm and struggle just at the verge of a harbour lost in
      golden light.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the helmsman&rsquo;s face?
    </p>
    <p>
      Clement and Lance neither of them said in words whose it was, as they both
      stood looking at it, and owned to themselves the steadfast face of their
      eldest brother, but Clement said, with a sigh&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! we are a long way as yet from that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very glad to hear you say so,&rdquo; exclaimed Lance; then laughing at
      himself, &ldquo;You are ever so much better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, I suppose I am to start again, going softly all my days, perhaps,
      and it is well, for I don&rsquo;t think the young generation can spare me yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor Cherry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How thankful I am to have Cherry restored to me I cannot say, and I do
      not feel convinced that there may not be care at hand with Gerald. The boy
      is in a reserved mood, very civil and amiable, but clearly holding back
      from confidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does she see it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but she fancies he bestows his confidence on Dolores Mohun, the girl
      from New Zealand, and resigns herself to be set aside. It is pretty well
      time that we went to meet her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For there was to be a dress rehearsal in the pavilion, to which certain
      spectators were to be admitted, chiefly as critics.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you walk up the hill, Clem?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, as long as I don&rsquo;t go too fast. Go on if you are wanted, and I will
      follow. Cherry has sent the carriage for an invalid who cannot venture to
      be there all the day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let them wait. A walk with you is not to be wasted. Run on, Fely, tell
      them we are coming,&rdquo; he added to his little Ariel, who had got lost in
      Jungle Beasts.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they went up the hill together, Clement not sorry to lean on his
      brother&rsquo;s arm, a dark woman of striking figure and countenance, though far
      from young, came up with them, accompanied by a stout, over-dressed man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the cigar-shop woman,&rdquo; said Lance, &ldquo;the mother of our pretty
      little Miranda.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder she chooses to show herself after her conviction,&rdquo; said Clement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if I am not much mistaken, that is the villain of The Sepoy&rsquo;s
      Revenge,&rdquo; said Lance. &ldquo;Poor little Butterfly, it is a bad omen for her
      future fate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As they reached the doors of the great hotel, they found the pair in
      altercation with the porter before the iron gate that gave admittance to
      the gardens. &ldquo;Mother Butterfly&rdquo; was pleading that she was the mother of
      Miss Schnetterling, who was singing, and the porter replying that his
      orders were strict.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not on any consideration,&rdquo; he repeated, as the man was evidently
      showing him the glance of silver, and a policeman, who was marching about,
      showed signs of meaning to interfere.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same moment Gerald&rsquo;s quick steps came up from the inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Lance; every one is crying out for you. Vicar, Cherie is
      keeping a capital place for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gate opened to admit them, and therewith Mrs. Schnetterling, trying to
      push in, made a vehement appeal&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Underwood, sir, surely the prima donna&rsquo;s own mother should not be
      excluded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her mother!&rdquo; said Gerald. &ldquo;Well, perhaps so, but hardly this&mdash;person,&rdquo;
       as his native fastidiousness rose at the sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; said the porter. &ldquo;Captain Henderson and Mr. Simmonds, they have
      specially cautioned me who I lets in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man grumbled something about swells and insolence, and Lance, with his
      usual instinct of courtesy, lingered to say&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is quite a private rehearsal&mdash;only the persons concerned!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if I&rsquo;m come on business,&rdquo; said the man confidentially. &ldquo;You are
      something in our line.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scarcely,&rdquo; said Lance, rather amused. &ldquo;At any rate, I don&rsquo;t make the
      regulations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sped away at the summons of his impatient son and Gerald.
    </p>
    <p>
      They met Captain Henderson on the way, and after a hasty greeting, he said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you have let in the Schnetterling woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One could not well keep out the mother,&rdquo; returned Lance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, no, but did she bring a man with her? My wife says the poor little
      Mona is in mortal terror lest he is come to inspect her for a circus
      company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite according to his looks,&rdquo; said Lance. &ldquo;Poor child, it may be her
      fate, but she ought to be in safe hands, but I suppose the woman wants to
      sacrifice her to present gain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They went on their way, and Lance and Gerald were soon absorbed in their
      cares of arrangement, while Clement was conducted to the seat reserved for
      him between his sister and Lady Merrifield. The pavilion had been fitted
      with stages of seats on the inner side, but the back&mdash;behind the
      stage&mdash;was so contrived that in case of favourable weather the real
      sea-view could be let in upon occasion, though the curtain and adjuncts,
      which had been painted by some of the deft fingers at Vale Leston,
      represented the cavern; also there was a first scene, with a real sail and
      mast.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a kind of semi-dress rehearsal, beginning with pirate songs by the
      school-master and choir, who had little difficulty in arranging themselves
      as buccaneers. The sail was agitated, then reefed, stormy songs were
      heard, where Captain Armytage did his part fairly well; the boatswain was
      gratified by roaring out his part characteristically, and the curtain fell
      on &ldquo;We split, we split, we split.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then came a song of Prospero, not much disguised by a plaid and Highland
      bonnet, interrupted by the pretty, graceful Miranda, very shy and
      ill-assured at first, but gathering strength from his gentle encouraging
      ways, while he told what was needful in the recitative that he alone could
      undertake. Then the elves and fairies, led by little Felix, in a charming
      cap like Puck, danced on and sang, making the prettiest of tableaux,
      lulling Miranda to sleep, and then Ariel conversing in a most dainty
      manner with Prospero.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next Ferdinand and Miranda had their scene, almost all songs and duets.
      Both sang very sweetly, and she had evidently gained in courage, and threw
      herself into her part.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shipwrecked party then came on the scene, performed their songs, and
      were led about Puck-fashion by the fairies, and put to sleep by the lament
      over Ferdinand. The buccaneers in like manner were deluded by more
      mischievous songs and antics, till bogged and crying out behind the
      scenes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their intended victims were then awakened, to find themselves in the
      presence of Prospero; sing themselves into the reconciliation, then mourn
      for Ferdinand, until the disclosure of the two lovers, and the final
      release of Ariel and the sprites, all singing Jacobite songs.
    </p>
    <p>
      To those who were not au fait with the &lsquo;Tempest&rsquo; and felt no indignation
      or jealousy at the travesty, it was charming; and though the audience at
      the rehearsal numbered few of these, the refined sweetness and power of
      the performers made it delightful and memorable. Every one was in raptures
      with the fairies, who had been beautifully drilled, and above all with
      their graceful little leader, with his twinkling feet and arch lively
      manner, especially in the parts with his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ferdinand and Miranda&mdash;or rather Angus and Mona&mdash;were quite
      ideal in looks, voices, and gestures.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Almost dangerously so,&rdquo; said Jane Mohun; &ldquo;and the odd thing is that they
      are just alike enough for first cousins, as they are here, though
      Shakespeare was not guilty of making them such.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The odd thing is,&rdquo; said Geraldine, as she drove home with Clement, &ldquo;that
      this brought me back so strangely to that wonderful concert at home, with
      all of you standing up in a row, and the choir from Minsterham, and poor
      Edgar&rsquo;s star.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An evil star!&rdquo; sighed Clement.

                              Lancelot said,
     That were against me, what I can I will;
     And there that day remained.&mdash;TENNYSON.
</pre>
    <p>
      It was on the night before the final bustle and fury, so to speak, of
      preparation were to set in, when arrivals were expected, and the sellers
      were in commotion, and he had been all day putting the singers one by one
      through their parts, that as he went to his room at night, there was a
      knock at Lancelot&rsquo;s door, and Gerald came in, looking deadly white. He had
      been silent and effaced all the evening, and his aunt had thought him
      tired, but he had rather petulantly eluded inquiry, and now he came in
      with&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lance, I must have it out with some one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An Oxford scrape?&rdquo; said Lance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no, I wish it was only that.&rdquo; Then a silence, while Lance looked at
      him, thinking, &ldquo;What trouble could it be?&rdquo; He had been very kind and
      gentle with the little Miranda, but the manner had not struck Lance as
      lover-like.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a gasp again&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That person, that woman at the gate, do you remember?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Therewith a flash came over Lance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor boy! You don&rsquo;t mean to say&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Neither could bring himself to say the word so sacred to Lancelot, and
      which might have been so sacred to his nephew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you guess?&rdquo; said Gerald, lifting up the face that he had hidden
      on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw the likeness between you and the girl. She reminded me of some one
      I had once seen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had you seen her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once, at a concert, twenty odd years ago. Your aunt, too, was strangely
      carried back to that scene, by the girl&rsquo;s voice, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor child!&rdquo; said Gerald, still laying down his head and seeming terribly
      oppressed, as Lance felt he well might be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a sad business for you,&rdquo; said the uncle, with a kind hand on his
      shoulder. &ldquo;How was it she did not claim you before?&mdash;not that she has
      any real claim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She did not know my real name. My father called himself Wood. I never
      knew the rest of it till after I came home. That fellow bribed the
      gardener, got in over the wall, or somehow, and when she saw you, and
      heard you and me and all three of us, it gave her the clue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Gerald, I do not think she can dare to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; interrupted Gerald, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s worse to come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; said Lance, aghast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She says,&rdquo; and a sort of dry sob cut him short, &ldquo;she says she had a
      husband when she married my father,&rdquo; and down went his head again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible,&rdquo; was Lance&rsquo;s first cry; &ldquo;your father&rsquo;s first care was to tell
      Travis all was right with you. Travis has the certificates.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, it was no fault of my father&mdash;my father, my dear father&mdash;no,
      but she deceived him, and I am an impostor&mdash;nobody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gently, gently, Gerald. We have no certainty that this is true. Your
      father had known her for years. Tell me, how did it come out&mdash;what
      evidence did she adduce?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gerald nerved himself to sit up and speak collectedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe it is half that circus fellow&rsquo;s doing. I think she is going to
      marry him, if she hasn&rsquo;t already. She followed me, and just at the turn
      down this road, as I was bidding the Mona girl goodnight, she came up with
      me, and said I little thought that the child was my sister, and how
      delightful it was to see us acting together. Well then, I can&rsquo;t say but a
      horror came over me. I couldn&rsquo;t for the life of me do anything but draw
      back, there was something so intolerable in the look of her eyes, and her
      caressing manner,&rdquo; and he shuddered, glad of his uncle&rsquo;s kind hand on his
      shoulder. &ldquo;Somehow, I let her get me out upon the high ground, and there
      she said, &lsquo;So you are too great a swell to have word or look for your
      mother. No wonder, you always were un vilain petit miserable; but I won&rsquo;t
      trouble you&mdash;I wouldn&rsquo;t be bound to live your dull ennuyant ladies&rsquo; 
      life for millions. I&rsquo;ll bargain to keep out of your way; but O&rsquo;Leary and I
      want a couple of hundred pounds, and you&rsquo;ll not grudge it to us.&rsquo; I had no
      notion of being blackmailed, besides I haven&rsquo;t got it, and I told her she
      might know that I am not of age, and had no such sum ready to hand. She
      was urgent, and I began to think whether I could do anything to save that
      poor little sister, when she evidently got some fresh impulse from the
      man, and began to ask me how I should like to have it all disclosed to my
      nobs of friends. Well, I wasn&rsquo;t going to be bullied, and I answered that
      my friends knew already, and she might do her worst. &lsquo;Oh, may I?&rsquo; she
      said; &lsquo;you wouldn&rsquo;t like, my fine young squire, to have it come out that I
      never was your father&rsquo;s wife at all, and that you are no more than that
      gutter-child.&rsquo; I could not understand her at first, and said I would not
      be threatened, but that made her worse, and that rascal O&rsquo;Leary came to
      her help. They raised their demands somehow to five hundred, and declared
      if they had not it paid down, they should tell the whole story and turn me
      out. Of course I said they were welcome. Either I am my father&rsquo;s lawful
      son, or I am not, and if not, the sooner it is all up with me the better,
      for whatever I am, I am no thief and robber. So I set off and came down
      the hill; but the brute kept pace with me to this very door, trying to
      wheedle me, I believe. And now what&rsquo;s to be done? I would go off at once,
      and let Uncle Clem come into his rights, only I don&rsquo;t want to be the death
      of him and Cherie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Lance, &ldquo;my dear fellow! You have stood it wisely and bravely so
      far, go on to do so. I don&rsquo;t feel the least certain that this is not mere
      bullying. She did not tell you any particulars?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, certainly not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the name of this supposed predecessor of Edgar&rsquo;s? Where she may have
      been married, or how? How she parted from him, or how she knows he was
      alive? It sounds to me a bogus notion, got up to put the screw on you, by
      surprise. I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ll do. I&rsquo;ll go down to the shop tomorrow
      morning, see the woman, and extract the truth if possible, and I fully
      expect that the story will shrink up to nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis not the estate I care for,&rdquo; said Gerald, looking somewhat cheered.
      &ldquo;It is my father&rsquo;s honour and name. If that can be cleared&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not I care?&rdquo; said Lance. &ldquo;My dear brother Edgar, my model of all that
      was noble and brilliant&mdash;whom Felix loved above all! Nay, and you,
      Gerald, our hope! I would give anything and everything to free you from
      this stain, though I trust it will prove only mud that will not stick.
      Anyway you have shown your true, faithful Underwood blood. Now go to bed
      and sleep if you can. Don&rsquo;t say a word, nor look more like a ghost than
      you can help&mdash;or we shall have to rouge ourselves for our parts. My
      boy, my boy! You are Edgar&rsquo;s boy, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Lancelot kissed the young pale cheek as he had done when the little
      wounded orphan clung to him fourteen years ago, or as he kissed his own
      Felix.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever the night was to Gerald, long was the night, and long the light
      hours of the morning to the ever sleepless Lance before he could rise and
      make his way to the shop with any hope of gaining admission, and many were
      the sighs and prayers that this tale might be confuted, and that the
      matter might be to the blessing of the youth to whom he felt more warmly
      now than since those winning baby days had given place to more ordinary
      boyhood. He had a long time to pace up and down watching the sparkling
      water, and feeling the fresh wind on the brow, which was as capable as
      ever of aching over trouble and perplexity, and dreading above all the
      effect on the sister, whose consolation and darling Gerald had always
      been. How little he had thought, when he had stood staunch against his
      brother Edgar&rsquo;s persuasions, that Zoraya was to be the bane of that life
      which had begun so gaily!
    </p>
    <p>
      When at last the door was unfastened, and, as before, by Ludmilla, he
      greeted her kindly, and as she evidently expected some fresh idea about
      the masque, he gave her his card, and asked her to beg her mother to come
      and speak to him. She started at the name and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sir, you will do nothing to hurt him&mdash;Mr. Underwood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the last thing I wish,&rdquo; he said earnestly, and Ludmilla showed him
      into a little parlour, full of the fumes of tobacco, and sped away, but he
      had a long time to wait, for probably Mother Butterfly&rsquo;s entire toilette
      had to be taken in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before she appeared Lancelot heard a man&rsquo;s voice, somewhere in the entry,
      saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! the young ass has been fool enough to let it out, has he? I suppose
      this is the chap that will profit? You&rsquo;ll have your wits about you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lance was still his old self enough to receive the lady with&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg to observe that I am not the &lsquo;chap who will profit&rsquo; if this
      miserable allegation holds water. I am come to understand the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman looked frightened, and the man came to her rescue, having
      evidently heard, and this Lance preferred, for he always liked to deal
      with mankind rather than womankind. Having gone so far there was not room
      for reticence, and the man took up the word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame cannot be expected to disclose anything to the prejudice of her
      son and herself, unless it was made worth her while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; said Lance, as he looked her over in irony, and drew the
      conclusion that the marriage was a fact accomplished; &ldquo;but she has
      demanded two hundred pounds from her son, on peril of exposure, and if the
      facts are not substantiated, there is such a thing as an action for
      conspiracy, and obtaining money on false pretences.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing has been obtained!&rdquo; said the woman, beginning to cry. &ldquo;He was
      very hard on his poor mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who forsook him as an infant, cast off his father, and only claims him in
      order to keep a disgraceful, ruinous secret hanging over his life for
      ever, in order to extort money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come now, this is tall talk, sir,&rdquo; said O&rsquo;Leary; &ldquo;the long and short of
      it is, what will the cove, yourself, or whoever it is that you speak for,
      come down for one way or another?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; responded Lance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither of the estimable couple spoke or moved under an announcement so
      incredible to them, and he went on&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gerald Underwood would rather lose everything than give hush-money to
      enable him to be a robber, and my elder brother would certainly give no
      reward for what would be the greatest grief in his life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      O&rsquo;Leary grinned as if he wanted to say, &ldquo;Have you asked him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The priest,&rdquo; she muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, the meddling parson who has done for you! He would have to come down
      pretty handsomely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lancelot went on as if he had not heard these asides.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a magistrate; I can give you in charge at once to the police, and
      have you brought before the Mayor for conspiracy, when you will have to
      prove your words, or confess them to be a lie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was not in the least certain that where there was no threatening
      letter, this could succeed, but he knew that the preliminaries would be
      alarming enough to elicit something, and accordingly Mrs. O&rsquo;Leary began to
      sob out&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was when I was a mere child, a bambina, and he used me so cruelly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was the first thread, and on the whole, the couple were angry enough
      with Gerald, his refined appearance and air of careless prosperity, to be
      willing that he should have a fall, and Lance thus extracted that the &ldquo;he&rdquo;
       who had been cruel was a Neapolitan impresario in a small way, who had
      detected that Zoraya, when a very little child, had a charming voice, of
      which indeed she still spoke with pride, saying Lida would never equal it.
      Her parents were semi-gipsies, Hungarian, and had wandered all over the
      Austrian empire, acting, singing, and bringing up their children to the
      like. They had actually sold her to the impresario, who had sealed the
      compact, and hoped to secure the valuable commodity by making her his
      wife. In his security he had trained her in the severest mode, and visited
      the smallest want of success with violence and harshness, so that her life
      was utterly miserable, and on meeting her brother, who had become a member
      of a German band, she had contrived to make her escape with him, and
      having really considerable proficiency, the brother and sister had
      prospered, and through sundry vicissitudes had arrived at being &ldquo;stars&rdquo; in
      Allen&rsquo;s troupe, where Edgar Underwood, or, as he was there known, Tom
      Wood, had unfortunately joined them; and the sequel was known to Lancelot,
      but he could not but listen and gather up the details, disgusted as he was&mdash;how
      the prima donna had accepted his attention as her right, till her jealousy
      was excited by his evident attraction to &ldquo;the little English doll, for
      whom he killed his man&rdquo;; how she resolved to win him, and how scandalous
      reports at last had brought him to offer marriage, unknowing, it was
      plain, of her past. It was not possible to guess how much she was still
      keeping back, speaking under terror and compulsion as she did. But she
      declared that he had never loved her, and was always wanting her to be
      like ces Anglaises fades, and as to her child, he so tormented her about
      it, and the ways of his absurd mother and sisters, and so expected her to
      sacrifice her art and her prospects to the little wretch, that she was
      ready to strangle it! &ldquo;Maternal love, bah! she was not going to be like a
      bird or a beast,&rdquo; she said, with a strange wild glance in her eyes that
      made Lance shudder, and think how much more he respected the bird or
      beast. Then at Chicago, when Wood&rsquo;s own folly and imprudence had brought
      on an illness that destroyed his voice, and she knew there would be only
      starvation, or she should have to toil for the whole of them,
      Schnetterling, manager of a circus, fell in love with her, and made her
      good offers to sing in Canada, and Chicago was a place where few questions
      were asked, so she freed herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had made her rounds with Schnetterling, a prudent German, and in
      process of time had come to England, where, at Avoncester, both had been
      attacked by influenza; he died, and she only recovered with a total loss
      of voice; but he had been prudent and frugal enough to save a sufficient
      sum to set her up at Rockquay with the tobacco-shop. She had chosen that
      place on account of American trading-vessels putting in there, as well as
      those of various foreign nations, with whom her knowledge of languages was
      available, and no doubt there were some opportunities of dealing in
      smuggled goods. Just, however, as the smuggling was beginning to be
      suspected, the circus of O&rsquo;Leary came in her way, and the old instincts
      were renewed. Then came the detection and prosecution, and the need of
      raising the fine. She had recourse to O&rsquo;Leary, who had before been
      Schnetterling&rsquo;s underling, and now was a partner in Jellicoe&rsquo;s circus, who
      knew her capabilities as a manager and actress, and perceived the
      probabilities of poor little Lida&rsquo;s powers. The discovery that the
      deserted baby that she had left at Chicago was a young handsome squire,
      well connected, and, in her eyes, of unlimited means, had of course
      incited both to make the utmost profit of him. That he should not wish to
      hush the suspicion up, but should go straight to his uncles, was to them a
      quite unexpected contingency.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this was not exactly told to Lancelot, but he extracted it, or
      gathered it before he was able to arrive at what was really important, the
      name of Zoraya&rsquo;s first husband, where she was married, and by whom, and
      where she had parted from him. She was so unwilling to give particulars
      that he began almost to hope to make her confess that the whole was a
      myth, but at last she owned that the man&rsquo;s name was Giovanni Benista, and
      that the marriage had taken place at Messina; she knew not in what church,
      nor in what year, only it was before the end of the old regime, for she
      recollected the uniforms of the Bomba soldiers, though she could not
      remember the name of the priest. Benista was old, very old&mdash;the
      tyrant and assassin that he was, no doubt he was dead. She often thought
      he would have killed her&mdash;and the history of his ill-treatment had to
      be gone through before it appeared that she had fled from him at Trieste
      with her brother, in an English trading-vessel, where their dexterity and
      brilliancy gained them concealment and a passage. This was certainly in
      the summer of 1865. Of Benista she knew nothing since, but she believed
      him to have come from Piedmont.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lance found Gerald walking up and down anxiously watching for him, and
      receiving him with a &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; that had in it volumes of suspense.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Gerald, I do not think there can be any blame attached to your
      father, whatever comes of it. He was deceived as much as any one else, and
      his attachment to you seems to have been his great offence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank Heaven! Then he was deceived?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid there was some previous ceremony. But stay, Gerald! There is
      no certainty that it was valid in the first place, and in the next,
      nothing is known of Benista since 1865, when he was an old man, so that
      there is a full chance that he was dead before&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before April 1868. I say, Uncle Lance, they want to make no end of a
      bear-fight for my coming of age. I must be out of the way first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry out too soon. Even if the worst came to the worst, as the
      property was left to you by will individually, I doubt whether this
      discovery, if real, would make any difference in law. I do not know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But would I take it on those terms? It would be simply defrauding
      Clement, and all of you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps, long before, we may be satisfied,&rdquo; said Lance. &ldquo;For the present,
      I think nothing can be done but endeavour to ascertain the facts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One comfort is,&rdquo; said Gerald, &ldquo;I have gained a sister. I have walked with
      her to the corner of her place&mdash;the marble works, you know&mdash;and
      she really is a jolly little thing, quite innocent of all her mother&rsquo;s
      tricks, thinking Mrs. Henderson the first of human beings, except perhaps
      Flight, the aesthetic parson. I should not have selected him, you know,
      but between them they have kept her quite a white sheet&mdash;a Miranda
      any Ferdinand might be glad to find, and dreading nothing so much as
      falling into the hands of that awful brute. Caliban himself couldn&rsquo;t have
      been worse! I have promised her to do what I can to save her&mdash;buy her
      off&mdash;anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor child,&rdquo; said Lance. &ldquo;But, Gerald, nothing of this must be said these
      next few days. We can&rsquo;t put ourselves out of condition for this same
      raree-show.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s a mere abomination to me,&rdquo; said Gerald disconsolately. &ldquo;I
      can&rsquo;t think why we should be dragged into all this nuisance for what is
      not even our own concern.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I thought you the rope that dragged me! At any rate much higher
      up on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I never thought you would respond&mdash;you, who have enough on
      your hands at Bexley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One stroke even on the outskirts is a stroke for all the cause.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The cause! I don&rsquo;t believe in the cause, whatever it is. What a
      concatenation now, that you and I should make fools of ourselves in order
      to stave off the establishment of national education, as if we could, or
      as if it was worth doing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why did you undertake it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, ah! Why, one wants something to do down here, and the Merrifield lot
      are gone upon it; and I did want to go through the thing again, but now it
      seems all rot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless, having pledged ourselves to the performance, we cannot cry
      off, and the present duty is to pack dull care away, put all this out of
      our heads, and regard it as a mere mare&rsquo;s nest as long as possible, and
      above all not upset Cherry. Remember, let this turn out as it will, you
      are yourself still, and her own boy, beloved for your father&rsquo;s sake, the
      joy of our dear brother, and her great comforter. A wretched mistake can
      never change that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lance&rsquo;s voice was quivering, and Gerald&rsquo;s face worked. Lance gave his hand
      a squeeze, and found voice to say&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Hold thee still in the Lord, and abide patiently upon Him.&rsquo; And meantime
      be a man over it. It can be done. I have often had to forget.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XIX. &mdash; SHOP-DRESSING
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     But I can&rsquo;t conceive, in this very hot weather,
     How I&rsquo;m ever to bring all these people together.
                                                 T. HOOD.
</pre>
    <p>
      It was not a day when any one could afford to be upset. It was chiefly
      spent in welcoming arrivals or in rushing about: on the part of Lance and
      Gerald in freshly rehearsing each performer, in superintending their stage
      arrangements, reviewing the dresses, and preparing for one grand final
      rehearsal; and in the multifarious occupations and anxieties, and above
      all in the music, Gerald did really forget, or only now and then
      recollect, that a nightmare was hanging on him, and that his little Mona
      need not shrink from him in maidenly shyness, but that he might well
      return her pretty appealing look of confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only quiet place in the town apparently was Clement Underwood&rsquo;s room,
      for even Cherry had been whirled off, at first to arrange her own pictures
      and drawings; and then her wonderful touch made such a difference in the
      whole appearance of the stall, and her dainty devices were so graceful and
      effective, that Gillian and Mysie implored her to come and tell them what
      to do with theirs, where they were struggling with cushions, shawls, and
      bags, with the somewhat futile assistance of Mr. Armine Brownlow and
      Captain Armytage, whenever the latter could be spared from the theatrical
      arrangements, where, as he said, it was a case of parmi les borgnes&mdash;for
      his small experience with the Wills-of-the-Wisp made him valuable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stalls were each in what was supposed to represent by turns a Highland
      bothie or a cave. The art stall was a cave, that the back (really a
      tool-house) might serve the photographers, and the front was decorated
      with handsome bits of rock and spar, even ammonites. Poor Fergus could not
      recover his horror and contempt when his collection of specimens, named
      and arranged, was very nearly seized upon to fill up interstices, and he
      was infinitely indebted to Mrs. Grinstead for finding a place where their
      scientific merits could be appreciated without letting his dirty stones,
      as Valetta called them, disturb the general effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And my fern-gardens! Oh, Mrs. Grinstead,&rdquo; cried Mysie, &ldquo;please don&rsquo;t send
      them away to the flower place which Miss Simmonds and the gardeners are
      making like a nursery garden! They&rsquo;ll snub my poor dear pterises.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly we&rsquo;ll make the most of your pterises. Look here. There&rsquo;s an
      elegant doll, let her lead the family party to survey them. That&rsquo;s right.
      Oh no, not that giantess! There&rsquo;s a dainty little Dutch lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charming. Oh! and here&rsquo;s her boy in a sailor&rsquo;s dress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is big enough to be her husband, my dear. You had better observe
      proportions, and put that family nearer the eye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those dolls!&rdquo; cried Valetta, &ldquo;they were our despair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make them tell a story, don&rsquo;t you see. Where&rsquo;s that fat red cushion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that cushion! I put it out of sight because it is such a monster.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; it is just like brick-dust enlivened by half-boiled cauliflowers!
      Never mind, it will be all the better background. Now, I saw a majestic
      lady reposing somewhere. There, let her sit against it. Oh, she mustn&rsquo;t
      flop over. Here, that match-box, is it? I pity the person deluded enough
      to use it! Prop her up with it. Now then, let us have a presentation of
      ladies&mdash;she&rsquo;s a governor&rsquo;s wife in the colonies, you see. Never mind
      costumes, they may be queer. All that will stand or kneel&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      right. Those that can only sit must hide behind, like poor Marie
      Antoinette&rsquo;s ladies on the giggling occasion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So she went on, full of fun, which made the work doubly delightful to the
      girls, who darted about while she put the finishing touches, transforming
      the draperies from the aspect of a rag-and-bone shop, as Jasper had called
      it, to a wonderful quaint and pretty fairy bower, backed by the Indian
      scenes sent by Mr. and Mrs. Bernard Underwood, and that other lovely one
      of Primrose&rsquo;s pasture. There the merry musical laugh of her youth was to
      be heard, as General Mohun came out with Lancelot to make a raid, order
      the whole party to come and eat luncheon at Beechcroft Cottage, and not
      let Mrs. Grinstead come out again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but I must finish up Bernard&rsquo;s clay costume figures. Look at the
      expression of that delightful dollie! I&rsquo;m sure he is watching the
      khitmutgars.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &lsquo;Above on tallest trees remote
             Green Ayahs perched alone;
           And all night long the Mussah moaned
             In melancholy tone.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      Oh, don&rsquo;t you know Lear&rsquo;s poem? Can&rsquo;t we illustrate it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cherry, Cherry, you&rsquo;ll be half dead to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if I am, this is the real fun. I shan&rsquo;t see the destruction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lance had her arm in his grip to take her over the bridge over the wall,
      when up rushed Kitty Varley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, if Mrs. Grinstead would come and look at our stall and set it right!
      Miss Vanderkist gave us hopes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Cherry, don&rsquo;t you know that you are not to be knocked up! There are
      the Travises going to bring unlimited Vanderkists.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, I know; but there&rsquo;s renovation in breaths from Vale Leston, and I
      really am of some use here.&rdquo; Her voice really had a gay ring in it. &ldquo;It is
      such fun too! Where&rsquo;s Gerald?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Having a smoke with the buccaneer captain. Oh, Miss Mohun, here&rsquo;s my
      sister, so enamoured of the bazaar I could hardly get her in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And oh! she is so clever and delightful. She has made our stall the most
      enchanting place,&rdquo; cried Primrose, dancing round. &ldquo;Mamma, you must come
      and have it all explained to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The very sight is supposed to be worth a shilling extra,&rdquo; said General
      Mohun, while Lady Merrifield and Miss Mohun, taking possession of her,
      hoped she was not tired; and Gillian, who had been wont to consider her as
      her private property, began to reprove her sisters for having engrossed
      her while she herself was occupied in helping the Hendersons with their
      art stall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The truth is,&rdquo; said Lance, &ldquo;that this is my sister&rsquo;s first bazaar, and so
      dear is the work to the female mind, that she can&rsquo;t help being sucked into
      the vortex.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it really?&rdquo; demanded Mysie, in a voice that made Mrs. Grinstead laugh
      and say&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such is my woeful lack of experience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have fallen on a bazaar wherever we went,&rdquo; said Lady Merrifield.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this is our first grown-up one, mamma,&rdquo; said Valetta. &ldquo;There was only
      a sale of work before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They all laughed, and Lance said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Stoneborough they seem like revenues&mdash;at least sales of work, for
      I can&rsquo;t say I understand the distinction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Recurring brigandages,&rdquo; said General Mohun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Uncle Reggie has never forgotten his getting a Noah&rsquo;s ark in a
      raffle,&rdquo; said Mysie.
    </p>
    <p>
      So went the merry talk, while one and another came in at Miss Mohun&rsquo;s
      verandah windows to be sustained with food and rest, and then darted forth
      again to renew their labours until the evening, Miss Mohun flying about
      everywhere on all sorts of needs, and her brother the General waiting by
      the dining-room to do the duties of hospitality to the strays of the
      families who dropped in, chattering and laughing, and exhausted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Merrifield was authorized to detain Mrs. Grinstead to the last moment
      possible to either, and they fell into a talk on the morality of bazaars,
      which, as Lady Merrifield said, had been a worry to her everywhere, while
      Geraldine had been out of their reach; since the Underwoods had done
      everything without begging, and Clement disapproved of them without the
      most urgent need; but, as Lance had said, his wife had grown up to them,
      and had gone through all the stages from delighting, acquiescing, and
      being bored, and they had so advanced since their early days, from being
      simply sales to the grand period of ornaments, costumes, and anything to
      attract.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clement consents,&rdquo; said Geraldine; &ldquo;as, first, it is not a church, and
      then, though it does seem absurd to think that singing through the
      murdered Tempest should be aiding the cause of the Church, yet anything to
      keep our children to learning faith and truth is worthy work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, it is working against the stream! How things are changed when
      school was our romance and our domain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you should hear Lance tell the story of his sister-in-law Ethel, how
      she began at Cocksmoor, with seven children and fifteen shillings, and
      thought her fortune made when she got ten pounds a year for the
      school-mistress; and now it is all Mrs. Rivers can do to keep out the
      School-board, because they had not a separate room for the hat-pegs!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We never had those struggles. We had enough to do to live at all in our
      dear old home days, except that my brother always taught Sunday classes.
      But anyway, this is very amusing. Those young people&rsquo;s characters come out
      so much. Ah, Gerald, what is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For Gerald was coming up to the verandah with a very pretty, dark-eyed,
      modest-looking girl in a sailor hat, who shrank back as he said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am come to ask for some luncheon for my&mdash;my Mona. She has had
      nothing to eat all day, and we still have the grand recognition scene to
      come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At which the girl blushed so furiously that the notion crossed Geraldine
      that he must have been flirting with the poor little tobacconist&rsquo;s
      daughter; but Lady Merrifield was exclaiming that he too had had nothing
      to eat, and General Mohun came forth to draw them into the dining-room,
      where he helped Ludmilla to cold lamb, salad, etc., and she sat down at
      Gerald&rsquo;s signal, very timidly, so that she gave the idea of only partaking
      because she was afraid to refuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gerald ate hurriedly and nervously, and drank claret cup. He said they
      were getting on famously, his uncle&rsquo;s chief strength being expended in
      drawing out the voice of the buccaneer captain, and mitigating the
      boatswain. Where were the little boys? Happily disposed of. Little Felix
      had gone through his part, and then Fergus had carried him and Adrian off
      together to Clipstone to see his animals, antediluvian and otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then in rushed Gillian, followed by Dolores.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, mother!&rdquo; cried Gillian, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a fresh instalment of pots and pans
      come in, such horrid things some of them! There&rsquo;s a statue in terra-cotta,
      half as large as life, of the Dirty Boy. Geraldine, do pray come and see
      what can be done with him. Kalliope is in utter despair, for they come
      from Craydon&rsquo;s, and to offend them would be fatal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kalliope and the Dirty Boy,&rdquo; said Mrs. Grinstead, laughing. &ldquo;A dreadful
      conjunction; I must go and see if it is possible to establish the line
      between the sublime and the ridiculous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I ask your nephew&rsquo;s leave to let you go,&rdquo; said Lady Merrifield,
      &ldquo;after all the orders I have received?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no&mdash;&rdquo; she began, but Gerald had jumped up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll steer you over the drawbridge, Cherie, if go you must. Yes,&rdquo;&mdash;to
      the young ladies&mdash;&ldquo;I appreciate your needs. Nobody has the same
      faculty in her fingers as this aunt of mine. Come along, Mona, it is Mrs.
      Henderson&rsquo;s stall, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ludmilla came, chiefly because she was afraid to be left, and Lady
      Merrifield could not but come too, meeting on the way Anna, come to
      implore help in arranging the Dirty Boy, before Captain Henderson knocked
      his head off, as he was much disposed to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gillian had bounded on before with a handful of sandwiches, but Dolores
      tarried behind, having let the General help her to the leg of a chicken,
      which she seemed in no haste to dissect. Her uncle went off on some other
      call before she had finished, eating and drinking with the bitter sauce of
      reflection on the fleeting nature of young men&rsquo;s attentions and even
      confidences, and how easily everything was overthrown at sight of a pretty
      face, especially in the half-and-half class. She had only just come out
      into the verandah, wearily to return to the preparations, which had lost
      whatever taste they had for her, when she saw Gerald Underwood springing
      over the partition wall. Her impulse was to escape him, but it was too
      late; he came eagerly up to her, saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is safe with Mrs. Henderson. I am to go back for her when our duet
      comes on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dolores did not want to lower herself by showing jealousy or offence, but
      she could not help turning decidedly away, saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am wanted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you? I wanted to tell you why I am so interested in her. Dolores, can
      you hear me now?&mdash;she is my sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your sister!&rdquo; in utter amaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every one says they see it in the colour of our eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every one&rdquo;&mdash;she seemed able to do nothing but repeat his words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my uncle Lancelot, and&mdash;and my mother. No one else knows yet.
      They want to spare my aunt till this concern is over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how can it be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a horrid business altogether!&rdquo; he said, taking her down to the
      unfrequented parts of the lower end of the garden, where they could walk
      up and down hidden by the bushes and shrubs. &ldquo;You knew that my father was
      an artist and musician, who fled from over patronage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I have heard so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He married a singing-woman, and she grew tired of him, and of me,
      deserted and divorced him in Chicago, when I was ten months old. He was
      the dearest, most devoted of fathers, till he and I were devoured by the
      Indians. If they had completed their operations on my scalp, it would have
      been all the better for me. Instead of which Travis picked me up, brought
      me home, and they made me as much of an heir of all the traditions as
      nature would permit, all ignoring that not only was my father Bohemian
      ingrain, but that my mother was&mdash;in short&mdash;one of the gipsies of
      civilization. They never expected to hear of her again, but behold, the
      rapturous discovery has taken place. She recognised Lance, the only one of
      the family she had ever seen before, and then the voice of blood&mdash;more
      truly the voice of £ s. d.&mdash;exerted itself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How was it she did not find you out before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father seems to have concealed his full name; I remember his being
      called Tom Wood. She married in her own line after casting him off, and
      this pretty little thing is her child&mdash;the only tolerable part of
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she cannot have any claim on you,&rdquo; said Dolores, with a more shocked
      look and tone than the words conveyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not she&mdash;in reason; but the worst of it is, Dolores, that the
      wretched woman avers that she deceived my father, and had an old rascally
      tyrant of an Italian husband, who might have been alive when she married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gerald!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dolores stood still and looked at him with her eyes opened in horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you may well say Gerald. &lsquo;Tis the only name I have a right to if
      this is true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are still yourself,&rdquo; and she held out her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not take it, however, only saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know what this means?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I do, but that does not alter you&mdash;yourself in yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you say that, Dolores, it will only alter me to make me&mdash;more&mdash;more
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She held out her hand again, and this time he did take it and press it,
      but he started, dropped it, and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not fair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, it is. I know what it means,&rdquo; she repeated, &ldquo;and it makes no
      difference,&rdquo; and this time it was she who took his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It means that unless this marriage is disproved, or the man&rsquo;s death
      proved, I am an outcast, dependent on myself, instead of the curled
      darling the Grinsteads&mdash;blessings on them!&mdash;have brought me up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether I don&rsquo;t like you better so,&rdquo; exclaimed she, looking
      into his clear eyes and fine open face, full of resolution, not of shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;While you say so&mdash;&rdquo; He broke off. &ldquo;Yes, thus I can bear it better.
      The estate is almost an oppression to me. The Bohemian nature is in me, I
      suppose. I had rather carve out life for myself than have the landlord
      business loaded on my shoulders. Clement and Lance will make the model
      parson and squire far better than I. &lsquo;The Inspector&rsquo;s Tour&rsquo; was a success&mdash;between
      that and the Underwood music there&rsquo;s no fear but I shall get an
      independent career.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! that is noble! You will be much more than your old self&mdash;as you
      said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The breaking of Cherie&rsquo;s heart is all that I care about,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;To
      her I was comfort, almost compensation for those brothers. I don&rsquo;t know
      how&mdash;&rdquo; He paused. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll let her alone till all this is over; so,
      Dolores, not one word to any one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, no!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I will&mdash;I will be true to you through
      everything, Gerald; I will wait till you have seen your way, and be proud
      of you through all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I can bear it&mdash;I have my incentive,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;First, you see,
      I must try to rescue my sister. I do not think it will be hard, for the
      maternal heart seems to be denied to that woman. Then proofs must be
      sought, and according as they are found or not&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loud calls of &ldquo;Gerald&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mr. Underwood&rdquo; began to resound. He finished&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must be <i>the</i> future.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Our</i> future,&rdquo; repeated Dolores.

      CHAPTER XX. &mdash; FRENCH LEAVE
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     She came, she is gone, we have met,
     And meet perhaps never again.&mdash;COWPER.
</pre>
    <p>
      The evening of that day was a scene of welcomes, dinners, and confusion.
      The Rotherwoods had arrived that evening at the Cliff Hotel just in time
      for dinner, of which they considerately partook where they were, to save
      Jane Mohun trouble; but all four of the party came the instant it was over
      to hear and see all that was going on, and were fervently received by
      Gillian and Mysie, who were sleeping at their aunt&rsquo;s to be ready for the
      morrow, and in spite of all fatigue, had legs wherewith to walk Lord
      Ivinghoe and Lady Phyllis round the stalls, now closed up by canvas and
      guarded by police. Phyllis was only mournful not to have assisted in the
      preparations, and heard all the fun that Mrs. Grinstead had made. But over
      the wall of Carrara a sight was seen for which no one was prepared&mdash;no
      other than Maura White&rsquo;s pretty classical face!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;how could I be away from such an occasion? I made Uncle
      White bring me to London&mdash;he had business there, you know&mdash;and
      then I descended on Kalliope, and wasn&rsquo;t she surprised! But I have a
      lovely Italian dress!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kalliope Henderson looked more alarmed than gratified on the whole. She
      knew that there had been no idea of Maura&rsquo;s coming till after it had been
      known that the Rotherwoods were to open the bazaar, and &ldquo;made Uncle White&rdquo;
       was so unlike their former relations that all were startled, Gillian
      asking in a tone of reproof how Aunt Adeline spared Maura.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we shall be back at Gastein in less than a week. I could not miss
      such an occasion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only had her telegram half-an-hour ago,&rdquo; said Kalliope, in an
      apologetic tone; and Lord Ivinghoe was to be dimly seen handing Maura over
      the fence. Moonlight gardens and moonlight sea! What was to be done? And
      Ivinghoe, who had begun life by being as exclusive as the Marchioness
      herself! &ldquo;People take the bit between their teeth nowadays,&rdquo; as Jane
      observed to Lady Rotherwood when the news reached her, and neither said,
      though each felt, that Adeline would not have promoted this expedition,
      even for the child whom she and Mr. White had conspired to spoil. Each was
      secretly afraid of the attraction for Ivinghoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      At St. Andrew&rsquo;s Rock there was a glad meeting with the Travis Underwoods,
      who had disposed of themselves at the Marine Hotel, while they came up
      with a select party of three Vanderkists to spend the evening with
      Clement, Geraldine, and Lancelot, not to mention Adrian, who had been
      allowed to sit up to dinner to see his sisters, and was almost devoured by
      them. His growth, and the improved looks of both his uncle and aunt, so
      delighted Marilda, that Lancelot declared the Rockquay people would do
      well to have them photographed &ldquo;Then&rdquo; and &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; as an advertisement of
      the place! But he was not without dread of the effect of the disclosure
      that had yet to be made, though Gerald had apparently forgotten all about
      it as he sat chaffing Emilia Vanderkist about the hospital, whither she
      was really going for a year; Sophy about the engineer who had surveyed the
      Penbeacon intended works, and Francie about her Miranda-Mona in strange
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Vanderkists all began life as very pretty little girls, but showed
      more or less of the Hollander ancestry as they grow up. Only Franceska,
      content with her Dutch name, had shot up into a beautiful figure, together
      with the fine features and complexion of the Underwood twins, and the
      profuse golden flax hair of her aunt Angela, so that she took them all by
      surprise in the pretty dress presented by Cousin Marilda, and chosen by
      Emilia. Sophy was round and short, as nearly plain as one with the family
      likeness could be, but bright and joyous, and very proud of her young
      sister. It was a merry evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, Lance himself was so much carried away by the spirit of the
      thing, and so anxious about the performance, that he made all the rest,
      including Clement, join in singing Autolycus&rsquo;s song, which was to precede
      the procession, to a new setting of his own, before they dispersed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Lance was beginning to dress in the morning when a knock came to his
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A note from Mr. Flight, please, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The note was&mdash;&ldquo;Circus and Schnetterlings gone off in the night! Shop
      closed! Must performance be given up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The town was all over red and blue posters! But Lance felt a wild hope for
      the future, and a not ill-founded one for the present. He rushed into his
      clothes, first pencilling a note&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                 &ldquo;Never say die.  L. 0. U.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Then he hurried off, and sent up a message to Miss Franceska Vanderkist,
      to come and speak to him, and he walked up and down the sitting-room where
      breakfast was being spread, like a panther, humming Prospero&rsquo;s songs, or
      murmuring vituperations, till Franceska appeared, a perfect picture of
      loveliness in her morning youthful freshness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Francie, there&rsquo;s no help for it. You must take Mona! She has absconded!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Lance!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, gone off in the night; left us lamenting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The horrible girl!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably not her fault, poor thing! But that&rsquo;s neither here nor there. I
      wish it was!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I thought&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is past thinking now, my dear. Here we are, pledged. Can&rsquo;t draw back,
      and you are the only being who can save us! You know the part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, in a way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did it with me at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes; but, Uncle Lance, it would be too dreadful before all these
      people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind the people. Be Mona, and only think of Alaster and Angus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what would mamma say, or Aunt Wilmet? And Uncle Clem?&rdquo; each in a more
      awe-stricken voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tackle them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know I shall be frightened and fail, and that will be worse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it won&rsquo;t, and you won&rsquo;t. Look here, Francie, this is not a
      self-willed freak for our own amusement. The keeping up the Church schools
      here depends upon what we can raise. I hate bazaars. I hate to have to
      obtain help for the Church through these people&rsquo;s idle amusement, but you
      and I have not two or three thousands to give away to a strange place in a
      lump; but we have our voices. &lsquo;Such as I have give I thee,&rsquo; and this
      ridiculous entertainment may bring in fifty or maybe a hundred. I don&rsquo;t
      feel it right to let it collapse for the sake of our own dislikes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, Uncle Lance, I&rsquo;ll do as you tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way to do it, my dear. At least, when you make ready,
      recollect, not that you are facing a multitude, but that you are saving a
      child&rsquo;s Christian faith; when you prepare, that you have to do with nobody
      but Gerald and me; when it comes to &lsquo;One, two, three, and away,&rsquo; mind
      nothing but your music and your cue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the dress, uncle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The dress is all safe at the pavilion. You must come up and rehearse as
      soon as you have eaten your breakfast. Oh, you don&rsquo;t know where. Well, one
      of us will come and fetch you. Good girl, Francie! Keep up your heart. By
      the bye, which is Fernan&rsquo;s dressing-room? I must prepare him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That question was answered, for Sir Ferdinand&rsquo;s door into the corridor was
      opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lance! I thought I heard your voice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, here&rsquo;s a pretty kettle of fish! Our Miranda has absconded, poor
      child. Happy thing you brought down Francie; nobody else could take the
      part at such short notice. You must pacify Marilda, silence scruples, say
      it is her duty to Church, country, and family. Can&rsquo;t stop!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lance, explain&mdash;do! Music-mad as usual!&rdquo; cried Sir Ferdinand,
      pursuing him down-stairs in despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>must</i> be music-mad; the only chance of keeping sane just now.
      There&rsquo;s an awful predicament! Can&rsquo;t go into it now, but you shall hear all
      when this is over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wherewith Lance was lost to view, and presently burst into St. Kenelm&rsquo;s
      Vicarage, to the relief of poor Mr. Flight, who had tried to solace
      himself with those three words as best he might.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. My niece, Franceska Vanderkist, who took the part before, and
      who has a very good soprano, will do it better as to voice, if not so well
      as to acting, as the Little Butterfly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, by good luck. I shall have her up to the pavilion to rehearse her
      for the afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Underwood, no words can say what we owe you. You are the saving of
      our Church education.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lance laughed at the magniloquent thanks, and asked how the intimation had
      been received.
    </p>
    <p>
      It appeared that on the previous evening O&rsquo;Leary had come to him, and, in
      swaggering fashion, had demanded twenty pounds as payment for his
      step-daughter&rsquo;s performance at the masque. Mr. Flight had replied that she
      had freely promised her services gratuitously for the benefit of the
      object in view. At this the man had scoffed, talked big about her value
      and the meanness of parsons, and threatened to withdraw her. Rather weakly
      the clergyman had said the question should be considered, but that he
      could do nothing without the committee, and O&rsquo;Leary had departed, uttering
      abuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      This morning &ldquo;Sweetie Bob,&rdquo; the errand-boy, had arrived crying, with
      tidings that the shop and house were shut up; nobody answered his knock;
      Mother Butterfly had &ldquo;cut&rdquo; in the night, gone off, he believed, with the
      circus, and Miss Lydia too; and there was two-and-ninepence owing to him,
      besides his&mdash;his&mdash;his character!
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew that Mother Butterfly had gone to the magistrates&rsquo; meeting the day
      before, and paid her fine of twenty-five pounds, and he also believed that
      she had paid up her rent, and sold her shop to a neighbouring pastry-cook,
      but he had never expected her to depart in this sudden way, and then he
      began to shed fresh tears over his two-and-ninepence and his character.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Flight began to reassure him, with promises to speak for him as an
      honest lad, while Lance bethought himself of the old organist&rsquo;s
      description of that wandering star, &ldquo;Without home, without country,
      without morals, without religion, without anything,&rdquo; and recollected with
      a shudder that turning-point in his life when Edgar had made him show off
      his musical talent, and when Felix had been sharp with him, and the office
      of the &lsquo;Pursuivant&rsquo; looked shabby, dull, and dreary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing more could be done, except to make bold assurances to Mr. Flight
      that Mona&rsquo;s place should be supplied, and then to hurry home, meeting on
      his way a policeman, who told him that the circus was certainly gone away,
      and promised to let him know whither.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was glad to find that Gerald had not come down-stairs, having overslept
      himself in the morning after a wakeful night. He was dressing when his
      uncle knocked at his door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is a shock, Gerald! I hope it is chiefly to our masque. These people
      have absconded, and carried off our poor little Mona.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? Absconded? My sister! I must be after them instantly,&rdquo; cried
      Gerald, wildly snatching at his coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What good would that do? you can&rsquo;t carry her off vi et armis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send the police.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No possibility. The fine is paid, the rent and all. They have gone, it
      seems, with the circus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Depend upon it that fellow has paid the fine, and bought the poor
      child into slavery with it. Carried her off in spite of our demurring, and
      the Vicar&rsquo;s prosecution. I must save her. I&rsquo;ll go after and outbid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No hurry, Gerald. A circus is not such a microscopical object but that it
      can be easily traced. A policeman has promised to find out where, and
      meanwhile we must attend to our present undertaking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gerald strode up and down the room in a fiery fit of impatience and
      indignation, muttering furious things, quite transformed from the
      listless, ironical youth hitherto known to his family.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; Lancelot said, &ldquo;our first duty is to do justice to our part;
      Francie Vanderkist will take Mona.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hang Mona! you care for nothing on earth but your fiddling and songs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not see that being frantic will make any difference to the
      situation. All in our power is being done. Meanwhile, we must attend to
      what we have undertaken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gerald rushed about a little more, but finally listened to his uncle&rsquo;s
      representation that the engrossing employment was good to prevent the
      peril of disturbing the two whom they were so anxious to spare. Fely came
      running up with a message that Aunt Cherie and Anna had been sent for to
      see about the decorations of the art stall, and that they would have to
      eat their breakfast without them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Appetite for breakfast was lacking, but Lance forced himself to swallow,
      as one aware of the consequences of fasting for agitation&rsquo;s sake, and he
      nearly crammed Gerald; so that Adrian and Fely laughed, and he excused
      himself by declaring that he wanted his turkey-cock to gobble and not
      pipe. For which bit of pleasantry he encountered a glare from Gerald&rsquo;s
      Hungarian eyes. He was afraid on one side to lose sight of his nephew, on
      the other he did not feel equal to encounter a scolding from Marilda, so
      he sent Adrian and Fely down to the Marine Hotel to fetch Franceska, while
      he stole a moment or two for greeting Clement, who was much better, and
      only wanted more conversation than he durst give him.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI. &mdash; THE MASQUE
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Your honour&rsquo;s players, hearing your amendment,
     Are come to play a pleasant comedy.
                                  Taming of the Shrew.
</pre>
    <p>
      Poor Franceska! First she encountered Cousin Marilda&rsquo;s wonder and
      displeasure, and the declaration that Uncle Lance went absolutely crazy
      over his musical mania. She had seen it before in poor Edgar, and knew
      what it came to. She wanted to telegraph at once to Alda to ask her
      consent or refusal to Franceska&rsquo;s appearance; but Sir Ferdinand stopped
      this on the ground that the circumstances could not be explained, and told
      her to content herself with Clement&rsquo;s opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      This she sent Sophy and Emilia to ascertain, before she would let them and
      the boys escort Francie to her destination. Clement, not yet up, had to
      hold a lit de justice, and pronounce that Uncle Lance was to be fully
      trusted to ask nothing unbecoming or unnecessary, and that Francie would
      have nothing to do with any one except him and Gerald.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; said Emilia, as they walked up, &ldquo;nobody will find it out. The
      posters are all over the town, &lsquo;Mona, Miss Ludmilla Schnetterling.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So the sisters were received with a murmur on their delay. The pretty
      dress prepared for Mona was found to be too small for the tall shapely
      Franceska, and Sophy undertook to alter it, while poor Francie&rsquo;s troubles
      began.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether it was that Uncle Lance and Gerald were in a secret state of
      turmoil, or that their requirements were a good deal higher than for the
      Vale Leston audience, or perhaps that she had no inheritance of actress
      traditions, they certainly were a great deal sharper with her than they
      had been ever before or with Ludmilla.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gerald derided her efforts sarcastically, and Uncle Lance found fault
      good-humouredly but seriously, and she was nearly in tears by eleven
      o&rsquo;clock, when the procession was to take place. She was quite surprised
      when Lance turned to her and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, my dear, you are doing capitally. I shall be proud of my
      daughter Mona.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Quite in spirits again, she was sewn by Sophy into her still unfinished
      dress, her beautiful light golden flax tresses were snooded, her Highland
      scarf pinned on her shoulder, and she hurried to her uncle, now be-robed
      and be-wigged, with Gerald in full Highland garb, looking very much
      disgusted, especially when her uncle said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well done, Francie. You&rsquo;ll cut that poor little thing out in looks and
      voice, if not in acting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, uncle, I sang so horridly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can do better if you try; I wish there was time to train you. We&rsquo;ll
      do the &lsquo;logs duet&rsquo; once more after this tomfoolery. Ha! Captain Armytage.
      You are an awful pirate, and no mistake. Where did you get that splendid
      horse-pistol?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From my native home, as well as my sword; but I wrote to Willingham for
      the rest. This will be an uncommonly pretty march-past. The girls look so
      well, and all out of doors too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was decidedly a great advantage, the trees, grass, and blue sky
      lending a great grace to the scene. The procession started from the garden
      entrance of the hotel, headed by the town band in uniform, and the fire
      brigade likewise, very proud of themselves, especially the little terrier
      whom nothing would detach from one of the firemen. Then came the four
      seasons belonging to the flower stall, appropriately decked with flowers,
      the Italian peasants with flat veils, bright aprons, and white sleeves,
      Maura White&rsquo;s beauty conspicuous in the midst, but with unnecessary nods
      and becks. Then came the &ldquo;mediaeval&rdquo; damsels in ruffs and high hats, the
      Highland maidens, with Valetta and Primrose giggling unmanageably; and
      Aunt Jane&rsquo;s troop of the various costumes of charity children, from the
      green frocks, long mittens, and tall white caps, and the Jemima Placid
      flat hats and long waists, down to the red cloaks, poke straw bonnets, and
      blue frocks of the Lady Bountiful age. These were followed by the merry
      fairies and elves; then by the buccaneers and the captive prisoners; and
      the rear was brought up by MacProspero, as Lord Rotherwood called him,
      with his niece on his arm and his nephew by his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the central stall, or bothie, in the Carrara grounds was reached,
      after passing in full state and order over two of the bridges, the
      procession halted before a group of the Rotherwood family, Sir Jasper and
      Lady Merrifield, Lady Flight, and other local grandees, with the clergy,
      who had declined to walk in procession. There the performers spread
      themselves out, singing Autolycus&rsquo;s song, led of course by MacProspero;
      Lady Rotherwood, with as much dignity as the occasion permitted, declared
      the bazaar open, and the Marquis hoped every one was going to ruin
      themselves in the cause of Christian education.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first idea of &ldquo;every one&rdquo; was luncheon, except that Lance laid hands
      on his unfortunate Angus and Mona for their duet, in the midst of which
      Lord Rotherwood made a raid on them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There! I&rsquo;m sure Prospero never was so cruel as to starve what&rsquo;s-his-name!
      Come in and have some food&mdash;it is just by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They found themselves in a dining-room, in the presence of Lady
      Rotherwood, her son and daughter, and a sprinkling of Merrifields and
      actors, in full swing of joyous chatter; Mysie and Lady Phyllis telling
      all that was specially to be admired, and Lord Rotherwood teasing them
      about the prices, and their wicked extortions in the name of goodness,
      Gillian snubbing poor Captain Armytage in his splendid buccaneer dress,
      Ivinghoe making himself agreeable to Franceska, whose heightened carnation
      tints made her doubly lovely through her shyness. Gerald and Dolores in
      the less lively vicinity of the Marchioness carrying on a low-toned
      conversation, which, however, enabled Gerald to sustain nature with food
      better than he had done at breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      It did not last long. The sellers had to rush off to relieve those who had
      begun the sale, and the performance was to commence at three o&rsquo;clock, so
      that the final preparations had to be hurried through.
    </p>
    <p>
      Geraldine had made the tour of the stalls on the arm of Anna, to admire
      them in their first freshness, and put finishing touches wherever
      solicited. The Rocca Marina conservatories were in rare glory, orchids in
      weird beauty, lovely lilies of all hues, fabulously exquisite ipomoeas,
      all that heart could wish. Before them a fountain played in the midst of
      blue, pink, and white lotus lilies, and in a flower-decked house the
      Seasons dispensed pot-flowers, bouquets, and button-holes; the Miss
      Simmondses and their friends with simpering graces, that made Geraldine
      glad to escape and leave them to the young men who were strolling up. At
      Carrara was the stall in which she was chiefly interested, and which had
      been arranged with a certain likeness to Italian gardens, the statues and
      other devices disposed among flowers; the Dirty Boy judiciously veiled by
      the Puzzle Monkey, and the front of the summer-house prolonged by pillars,
      sham but artistic. Jasper was zealously photographing group after group,
      handing his performances over to his assistant for printing off. Kalliope
      looked in her costume most beautiful and dignified. Her sister, grown to
      almost equal beauty, was hurrying off to see the masque, flushed and
      eager, while Gillian and one or two others were assisting in sales that
      would be rather slack till after the performance. Here Geraldine purchased
      only a couple of Mouse-traps, leaving further choice to be made after the
      stranger purchasers. Here Sir Jasper and General Mohun came up, and gave
      her a good deal of curious information about Bernard&rsquo;s bevy of figures in
      Indian costumes; and having the offer of such a strong arm as the
      General&rsquo;s, she dispensed with Anna, who was really wanted to help with the
      very popular photographs.
    </p>
    <p>
      They passed the refreshments, at present chiefly haunted by Mrs. Edgar&rsquo;s
      boys, ready to eat at any time of day; they looked civilly at the Varley
      Elizabethans, and found Lady Merrifield in the midst of her bothie, made
      charming with fresh green branches and purple heather, imported by the
      Vanderkists.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Penbeacon ling. I know that red tint in the mauve,&rdquo; said
      Geraldine; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you half-a-crown, if your decorations can spare that
      spiring spray!&rdquo; And she put it in her bosom, after touching it with her
      lips. &ldquo;You have a bower for the Lady of the Lake,&rdquo; she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m only Roderick Dhu&rsquo;s mother,&rdquo; laughed Lady Merrifield; &ldquo;but
      I shall have more ladies when the masque is done. Now I have only Mysie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And oh!&rdquo; cried Mysie, &ldquo;please set up the nurse in the nursery gardens
      right. Wilfred knocked her over, and she won&rsquo;t stand right for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perverse woman. There! No, I shall not buy anything now, I shall wait for
      Primrose and the refuse. How pretty it does all look! Ah, Mr. Brownlow,&rdquo;
       as she shook hands with the curate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I left my brother John at your house,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I persuaded him to run
      down this morning with my mother and see our doings, and he was glad of
      the opportunity of looking in upon the Vicar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How very kind of him. We were wishing to know what he thought!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt he will be here presently. My mother is at the masque. There was
      not a seat for us, so I took him down to St. Andrew&rsquo;s Rock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a seat! The five-shilling seats?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the fraction of one. Numbers standing outside! Pity there can&rsquo;t be a
      second performance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four hundred seats! That&rsquo;s a hundred pounds! We shall beat the
      School-board yet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So, with the General politely expressing that there was no saying what
      Rockquay owed to the hearty co-operation of such birds of passage as
      herself and her brothers, she travelled on to the charity stall, which
      Miss Mohun had quaintly dressed in the likeness of an old-fashioned
      school, with big alphabet and samplers, flourished copies, and a stuffed
      figure of a &lsquo;cont-rare-y&rsquo; naughty boy, with a magnificent fool&rsquo;s cap. She
      herself sat behind it, the very image of the Shenstone school-mistress,
      with wide white cap, black poke-bonnet, crossed kerchief, red cloak, and
      formidable rod; and her myrmidons were in costume to match. It was very
      attractive, and took every one by surprise, but Geraldine had had enough
      by this time, and listened to Miss Mohun&rsquo;s invitation and entreaty that
      she would preside over tea-cups for the weary, in the drawing-room. The
      privacy of the houses had been secured by ropes extending from the stalls
      to the rails of the garden, and Geraldine was conducted by her two
      generals to the verandah, where they installed her, and lingered, as was
      usual with her squires, always won by her spirited talk, till messages
      came to each of them from below that some grandee was come, who must be
      talked to and entertained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Already, however, Armine Brownlow had brought up his brother, the doctor&mdash;John
      or Jock, an old friend&mdash;over, first Clement&rsquo;s district and then his
      bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mrs. Grinstead, I can compliment you much on your brother. He is
      very materially better, and his heart is recovering tone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very glad and thankful! I only wish you had seen him last week. He
      was better then, but he had a worry about our little nephew, which threw
      him back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he told me. The more quiescent and amused you can keep him, the more
      chance of a fair recovery there will be. I am glad he thinks of dining
      with the party to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad he still thinks. I had to come away early, when he had still
      left it doubtful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I encouraged the idea with all my might.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think he will be able to go back to his parish?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most assuredly not while every worry tells on him in this manner. You
      must, if possible, take him abroad for the winter, before he begins to
      think about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has leave of absence for a year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dating from Easter, I think. Keep him in warm climates as long as you
      can. Find some country to interest him without over-fatigue, and you will,
      I hope, be able to bring him home fit to consider the matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all you promise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All I dare&mdash;not even to promise&mdash;but to let you hope for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An interruption came; one of the young ladies had had her skirt trodden
      on, and wanted it to be stitched up. Then came Jane Mohun to deposit a
      handkerchief which some one had dropped. &ldquo;I can stay a moment,&rdquo; she said;
      &ldquo;no one will come to buy till the masque is ended. Oh, this red cloak will
      be the death of me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look highly respectable without it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall only put it on for the coup d&rsquo;oeil at first. Oh, Geraldine, what
      is to be done with that horrid little Maura?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The pretty little Greek girl&mdash;Mrs. Henderson&rsquo;s sister?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! it is not Mrs. Henderson&rsquo;s fault, nor my sister Ada&rsquo;s either, except
      that the little wretch must have come round her. I know Ada meant to stay
      away on that very account.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What account?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ivinghoe&rsquo;s, to be sure! Oh! I forgot. You are so much one of us that I
      did not remember that you did not know how the foolish boy was attracted&mdash;no,
      that&rsquo;s too strong a word&mdash;but she thought he was, when they were here
      to open Rotherwood Park. He did flirt, and Victoria&mdash;his mother, I
      mean&mdash;did not like it at all. She would never have come this time,
      but that I assured her that Maura was safe at Gastein!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it so very undesirable?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear! Their father was old White&rsquo;s brother, a stone-mason. He was
      raised from the ranks, but his wife was a Greek peasant&mdash;and if you
      had seen her, when the Merrifield children called her the Queen of the
      White Ants! Ivinghoe is naturally as stiff and formal as his mother, I am
      not much afraid for him, except that no one knows what that fever will
      make of a young man, and I don&rsquo;t want him to get his father into a scrape.
      There, I have exhaled it to you, and there is a crowd as if the masque was
      done with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was, and the four hundred auditors were beginning to throng about the
      stalls, strays coming up from time to time, and reporting with absolute
      enthusiasm on the music and acting. Marilda was one of these.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Cherry, I saw no great harm in it after all, and Francie looked
      sweetly pretty, just as poor Alda did when she first came to us. Lance
      must make his own excuses to Alda. But Gerald looked horridly ill! He sang
      very well, but he had such red spots on his cheeks! I&rsquo;d get Clement&rsquo;s
      doctor to sound him. Lord Rotherwood was quite complimentary. Now I must
      go and buy something&mdash;I hear there is the Dirty Boy&mdash;I think I
      shall get it for Fernan&rsquo;s new baths and wash-houses. Then isn&rsquo;t there
      something of yours, Cherry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to compete with the Dirty Boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! now you are laughing at me, Cherry. Quite right, I am glad to hear
      you do it again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next visitor was Lance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Cherry, how cool you look! Give me a cup of tea&mdash;not
      refreshment-stall tea. That&rsquo;s right. Little Francie is a perfect gem&mdash;looks
      and voice&mdash;not acting&mdash;no time for that. Heigh-ho!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Gerald?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somewhere about after that Merrifield niece with the doleful name, I
      fancy. He did very well when it came to the scratch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you seen Dr. Brownlow? He has been to see Clement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s first-rate! Where shall I find him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somewhere about, according to your lucid direction, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does he think of old Tina?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Geraldine told him, and was rather surprised, when he whistled as though
      perplexed, and as Fergus rushed in, glorious with the news that Sir
      Ferdinand had bought his collection of specimens for the Bexley museum, he
      rose up, looking perturbed, to find Dr. Brownlow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next came Gillian with news that the Dirty Boy was sold to Lady Travis
      Underwood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And mayn&rsquo;t I stay a moment or two?&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Now the masque is over,
      that Captain Armytage is besetting me again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Captain Armytage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you pity him? He is going to join his ship, the Sparrow Hawk, next
      week, and that ought to content him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ships do not always fill a man&rsquo;s heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then they ought. I don&rsquo;t like it,&rdquo; she added, in a petulant tone. &ldquo;I have
      so much to learn and to do, I don&rsquo;t want to be tormented about a tiresome
      man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he will be out of your way to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Geraldine, that is a horrid tone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you choose to put meaning in it, I cannot help it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that horrid little Maura! She is in the most awful flutter, standing
      on tiptoe, and craning out her foolish little neck. I know it is all after
      Ivinghoe, and he never has come to our counter! Kalliope has been trying
      to keep her in order, but I&rsquo;m sure the Queen of the White Ants must have
      been just like that when she got poor Captain White to marry her. Kalliope
      is so much vexed, I can see. She never meant to have her here. And Aunt
      Ada stayed away on purpose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has she seen much of him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hardly anything; but he did admire her, and she never was like Kalliope.
      But what would Aunt Ada do? Oh dear! there&rsquo;s that man! He has no business
      at Aunt Jane&rsquo;s charity stall. I shall go and tell him so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Geraldine had her little private laugh before Adrian came up to her with a
      great ship in his arms&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care of this, Aunt Cherry. She is going to sail on the Ewe. I bought
      her with the sovereign Uncle Fernan gave me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Geraldine gave the ship her due admiration, and asked after the masque.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that went off pretty well. I wouldn&rsquo;t have been Fely! All the ladies
      went and said &lsquo;Pretty dear!&rsquo; when he sang his song about the bat&rsquo;s back.
      Disgusting! But then he has not been a fellow at school, so he made his
      bow and looked as if he didn&rsquo;t mind it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Francie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Francie looked perfectly stunning. Everybody said so, and she sang&mdash;well,
      she sang better than she did at home; but she was in an awful funk, though
      I kept on looking at her, and shouting bravo to encourage her; and she
      must have heard my voice, for I was just in front.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope she was encouraged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she is very stupid. I wanted to take her round to all the stalls, and
      show her what to buy with the five Jubilee sovereigns Uncle Fernan gave
      her, for you know she has never been anywhere, or seen anything. I thought
      she would like it, and besides, all our fellows say they never saw such an
      awfully pretty girl, and they can&rsquo;t believe all that hair is her own&mdash;she
      had it all down her back, you know&mdash;so I told them I would let them
      have a pull to try.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Francie! She declined, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there was that ridiculous swell, Fergus&rsquo;s cousin, Ivinghoe, and he
      has taken her off to see the stupid flowers in the conservatory. I told
      Sophy I wondered she permitted such flirting, but of course Francie knew
      no better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! and you couldn&rsquo;t stop it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not I, though I called her over and over again to look at things, but
      Lord Ivinghoe always hung about and gave one no peace. So I just told
      Sophy to look after her, and came off to tell you. Oh my! here is old Miss
      Mohun coming up. I shall be off. I want some chocolate creams. Mrs.
      Simmonds has got some splendid ones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Mohun was coming, in fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Geraldine, the masque was a great success. People beg to have it
      repeated, so many could not get in. And it is worth at least a hundred
      pounds to us. People whose opinion is worth having were quite struck. They
      say your brother really ought to have been a great composer and singer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think he might have been if he had not given up his real passion to
      come to the help of my dear eldest brother. And he is really happier as he
      is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew there was conquest in his face. And that dear little elf of a boy&mdash;what
      a voice! So bright and so arch too. Then the Miranda&mdash;she took all by
      surprise. I believe half the spectators took her for the Little
      Butterfly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, the poor Little Butterfly is flown. There was nothing for it but to
      make Francie act, as she had taken the part once before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her acting was no great things, they say&mdash;ladylike, but frightened.
      Her voice is lovely, and as to her looks&mdash;people rave about them.
      Tell me, she is not Lady Travis Underwood&rsquo;s daughter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no; she is Anna&rsquo;s sister, Adrian&rsquo;s sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I told Lady Rotherwood, I was sure it was so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Travis Underwoods have no children, but they adopted Emilia when I
      took Anna, and they have brought three Vanderkists to this affair. Francie
      has never been from home before, it is all quite new to her.&rdquo; Then
      recollecting what Adrian had repeated, she thought it fair to add, &ldquo;My
      sister was left very badly off, and all these eight girls will have
      nothing of their own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t suppose anything will come of it. I hope it will put no
      folly into her head; but at any rate it effaces that poor silly little
      Maura. I hope too, as you say your niece is so innocent, it will do her no
      harm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose any possibilities have occurred to the child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Rotherwood here came on the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jenny, there&rsquo;s an offer for your boy in the fool&rsquo;s cap, and Mysie doubts
      if she ought to let him go. Well, Mrs. Grinstead, I think you have the
      best of it. Lookers on, etc.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looking on has always been my trade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You heard the rehearsal of the masque, I believe, but you did not hear
      that charming Mona?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; she had to take the part suddenly. Her uncle had to tyrannize over
      her, to save the whole thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are much indebted to him, and to her,&rdquo; said Lord Rotherwood
      courteously. &ldquo;She looked as if she hated it all in the first scene, though
      she warmed up afterwards. I must say I liked her the better for her
      shyness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her little brother thinks she recovered in consequence of his applause,&rdquo;
       said Geraldine, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I saw him. And heard. A little square fellow&mdash;very sturdy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the Dutchman comes out in him, and he has droll similitudes, very
      curious in one who never saw his father, nor any but his Underwood
      relations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the better for him perhaps; I have, and ought to have, great
      faith in uncles&rsquo; breeding. I am glad to meet Sir Ferdinand Travis
      Underwood. I have often come across him about London good works.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he is an excellent man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not wholly English is he, judging by the depth of colour in those eyes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; his mother was a Mexican, partly Indian. We used to call him the
      Cacique;&rdquo; and Geraldine had the pleasure of telling his story to an
      earnest listener, but interruption came in the shape of Sir Ferdinand
      himself who announced that he had hired a steam-yacht wherein to view the
      regatta, and begged Lord Rotherwood to join the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was impossible, as the Marquis was due at an agricultural dinner at
      Clarebridge, but in return, in the openness of his heart, he invited the
      Travis Underwoods to their dinner that evening at the hotel, where the
      Merrifields and the Underwoods were already engaged, little boys and all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, my lord, but we are too large a party. We have three
      Vanderkist girls with us, and Anna and her brother are to join them to be
      with their sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, never mind. The great hall will have room for all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still Fernan demurred, knowing that Marilda had ordered dinner at the Quay
      Hotel, and that even liberal payment would not atone for missing the
      feasting of the millionaires; so the matter was compounded by his promise
      to bring all his party, who were not ready for bed, up to spend the
      evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Geraldine perceived from Lady Rotherwood&rsquo;s ceremonious politeness that
      she did not like it at all, though she never said so even to Lady
      Merrifield.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, it was a very bright evening. Gerald had sung himself into
      spirits, and then found Dolores, and retreated into the depths of the
      garden with her, explaining to her all about his sister, and declaring
      that his first object must be to rescue her; and then, unless his name was
      cleared, and he had to resume all his obligations, the new life would be
      open to him, and he had no fear of not succeeding as a journalist, or if
      not, a musical career was possible to him, as Dolores had now the
      opportunity of fully perceiving. His sweet voice had indeed filled her
      with double enthusiasm. She had her plan for lecturing, and that very
      morning she had received from her father permission to enter a ladies&rsquo; 
      college, and the wherewithal. She would qualify herself for lecturing by
      the time he had fixed his career; and they built their airy castles, not
      on earth, but on railroads and cycles, and revelled on them as happily as
      is common to lovers, whether in castle or in cottage. Certainly if the
      prospect held out to her had been Vale Leston Priory, it would not have
      had the same zest; and when in the evening they joined the dinner-party,
      there was a wonderful look of purpose and of brightness on both their
      faces. And Emilia, who had been looking for him all the afternoon to tell
      him, &ldquo;Gerald, I am really going to be a nurse,&rdquo; only got for answer an
      absent &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, at St. Roque&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope I shall never be a patient there,&rdquo; he said, in his half-mocking
      tone. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll look jolly in the cap and apron.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m to be there all the time they are in America, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I wonder you don&rsquo;t go and study the institutions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Gerald&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His eye was wandering, and he sprang forward to give Dolores a flower that
      she had dropped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lancelot, knowing what was before Gerald, and having always regarded Vale
      Leston with something of the honours of Paradise, could not understand
      that joyous look of life, so unlike Gerald&rsquo;s usual weary, passive
      expression. He himself felt something of the depression that was apt to
      follow on musical enjoyment; he saw all the failures decidedly enough not
      to be gratified with the compliments he met on all sides, and &ldquo;he bitterly
      thought on the morrow,&rdquo; when he saw how Clement was getting animated over
      a discussion on Church matters, and how Geraldine was enjoying herself.
      And as to that pretty Franceska, who had blossomed into the flower of the
      flock, he foresaw heart-break for her when he watched the Marchioness&rsquo;s
      countenance on hearing that her son had accepted Sir Ferdinand&rsquo;s
      invitation to cruise to-morrow in the yacht.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vainly was Ivinghoe reminded of the agricultural dinner. He was only too
      glad to escape it, and besides, he thought he could be there in time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, the present was delightful, and after dinner the young
      people all went off to the great assembly-room, whence Anna came back to
      coax Uncle Lance to play for them. All the elders jumped up from their
      several discussions. Even Lady Rotherwood moved on, looking as benign as
      her feelings would permit. Jane squeezed Geraldine&rsquo;s arm, exceedingly
      amused. Lance struck up, by request, an old-fashioned country dance; Lord
      Rotherwood insisted that &ldquo;Lily&rdquo; should dance with him, as the remnant of
      forty good years ago or more, and with Sir Roger de Coverley the day
      ended.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor little Maura, making an excuse to wander about the gardens in the
      moonlight, saw the golden locks shining through the open windows, and Lord
      Ivinghoe standing over them, went home, and cried herself to sleep over
      the fickleness of the nobility, when she had better have cried over her
      own unjustified romance, excited by a few kindly speeches and a cup of
      tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Emilia! What was Gerald&rsquo;s one laughing turn with her, compared with
      his long talk with Dolores in the moonlight?

      CHAPTER XXII. &mdash; THE REGATTA
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     She saw a forget-me-not in the grass,
     Gilly-flower, gentle rosemary,
     Ah! why did the lady that little flower pass,
     While the dews fell over the mulberry-tree?
                                            KENEALY.
</pre>
    <p>
      Such of the party as were not wanted for the second day of the bazaar, and
      were not afraid of mal de mer, had accepted the yachting invitation,
      except the three elders at St. Andrew&rsquo;s Rock. Even Adrian and Felix were
      suffered to go, under Sophy&rsquo;s charge, on the promise to go nowhere without
      express permission, and not to be troublesome to any one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sophy can say, &lsquo;Now, boys,&rsquo; as effectively as Wilmet,&rdquo; said Geraldine,
      when she met Lance, who had been to the quay to see them off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She did not say so to much advantage with her own boys,&rdquo; said Clement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We weren&rsquo;t Harewoods,&rdquo; returned Lance, &ldquo;and John never could bear to see
      a tight hand over them; but there&rsquo;s good in them that will come out some
      day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clement gave an emphatic &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; as he sat down to the second breakfast
      after Anna had gone to the cliff to resume her toils.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are gone?&rdquo; asked Geraldine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Marilda, smilingly declaring she shall be in misery in the cabin all
      the time, Fernan, and four Vanderkists, General Mohun, Sir Jasper, and
      some of his progeny; but others stay to help Miss Mohun finish up the
      sales.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does Lord Ivinghoe go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, he came rushing down just in time. Francie was looking like a
      morning rose off the cloister at Vale Leston.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry they have another day of it. I don&rsquo;t see how it can come to
      good,&rdquo; said Geraldine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps her roses may fade at sea,&rdquo; said Clement, &ldquo;and disenchantment may
      ensue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least I hope Alda may not hear of it, or she will be in an agony of
      expectation as long as hope lasts. Gerald is gone, of course?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes!&rdquo; said Lance, who had had a farewell from him with the words, &ldquo;Get
      it over while I am out of the way, and tell them I don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cursory and incomprehensible, but conclusive; and Lance, who minded enough
      to have lost sleep and gained a headache, marvelled over young men&rsquo;s
      lightness and buoyancy. He had seen Dr. Brownlow, and arranged that there
      should be a call, as a friend, in due time after the communication, in
      case it should hurt Clement, and when Geraldine observed merrily that now
      they were quit of all the young ones they could feel like old times, he
      was quite grieved to disturb her pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clement, however, began by taking out a letter and saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is a remarkable missive left for me yesterday&mdash;&lsquo;If the Rev.
      Underwood wishes to hear of something to his advantage, he should
      communicate with Mr. O&rsquo;L., care of Mr. John Bast, van proprietor,
      Whitechapel.&rsquo; An impostor?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid not,&rdquo; said Lance. &ldquo;Clement, I fear there is no doubt that she
      is that singing Hungarian woman who was the ruin of Edgar&rsquo;s life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gerald&rsquo;s mother!&rdquo; exclaimed Geraldine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she is gone! She gave up all rights. She can&rsquo;t claim anything. Has
      she worried him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, poor boy! She has declared that she had actually a living husband at
      the time she married our poor Edgar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of course both broke out into exclamations that it was impossible, and
      Lance had to tell them of his interview with the woman at Gerald&rsquo;s
      entreaty. They were neither of them so overcome by the disclosure as he
      had feared during his long delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe it is only an attempt at extortion,&rdquo; said Clement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very cruel,&rdquo; said Geraldine. &ldquo;How&mdash;how did my poor boy bear it all
      this time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was very much knocked down at first, quite overwhelmed, but less by
      the loss than by the shame, and the imputation on his father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was no fault of dear Edgar&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed. I am glad Fernan is here to go over again what Edgar told
      him. We may be quite satisfied so far.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is it needful to take it up?&rdquo; asked Geraldine wistfully. &ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t
      believe it, the horrid story would get quashed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Cherry,&rdquo; said Clement. &ldquo;If you think it over you will see that we
      must investigate. I should be relieved indeed to let it alone, but it
      would not be fair towards Lance there and his boys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lance made a strange noise of horror and deprecation, then added&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe Gerald would consent to let it alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, now he knows, of course. He is a right-minded, generous boy,&rdquo; said
      Geraldine. &ldquo;I was wrong. Did you say he was very much upset?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just at first, when he came to me at night. I was obliged to dragoon him,
      and myself too, to throw it off enough to be able to get through our
      performance yesterday. How thankful I am to the regatta that it is not our
      duty to the country to go through it again to-day! However, he seems to
      have rebounded a good deal. He was about all the latter part of the day
      with Miss Mohun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw him dancing and laughing with some of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he parted from me very cheerfully, telling me to assure you &lsquo;he did
      not mind,&rsquo; whatever that may mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He knows that nothing can disturb our love for him, Edgar&rsquo;s little
      comfort, passed on to bear us up,&rdquo; said Cherry tearfully. &ldquo;Oh yes, I know
      what he meant&mdash;Felix&rsquo;s delight, my darling always.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It strikes me,&rdquo; said Lance, &ldquo;that if he can save his sister&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Geraldine started.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the cigar-girl! Only by that mother&rsquo;s side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true, but she is his half-sister, and he is evidently much drawn
      towards her. She is a nice little thing, and I believe he made much of her
      on the rehearsal day. I saw they got on much better together, and I think
      she was aware of the relationship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is quite right of him,&rdquo; said Geraldine, &ldquo;but she will be a drag
      on him all his life. Now what ought we to do? Shall you answer this letter
      to the care of the van-man, Clem?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall think, and wait till I have seen Gerald and Travis. This letter
      is evidently written simply in the hope of raising money from me, not in
      any friendly spirit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; said Lance. &ldquo;Having failed to black-mail Gerald, and
      discovered that you are the heir, they begin on you, but not from any
      gratitude to you. Sweetie Bob, as they call the ex-errand-boy, gives a
      fine account of their denunciations of the tall parson who brought the
      bobbies down on them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lance felt much reassured by Clement&rsquo;s tone, and all the more when he had
      seen Dr. Brownlow, who made a thorough examination, and came to the
      conclusion that Clement had recovered tone, so that the shock, whatever it
      was, that his brother dreaded had done no present damage, but that he was
      by no means fit for any strain of work or exertion, should be kept from
      anxiety as much as possible, and had better spend the winter in a warm
      climate. It was not likely&mdash;Jock Brownlow said it with grief and pain&mdash;that
      he would ever be able to return to the charge of St. Matthew&rsquo;s, but as he
      had a year&rsquo;s holiday, there was no need to enter on that subject yet, and
      in a quiet country place, with a curate, he might live to the age of man
      in tolerable health if he took care of himself, or his sister took care of
      him for some time to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      So much relieved was Lance that he recollected that he had laid in no
      stock of presents for those at home, and went up to profit by the second
      day&rsquo;s reductions, when he secured Geraldine&rsquo;s portrait of Davy Blake for
      his wife, and a statuette of St. Cecilia for Dr. May, some charming
      water-colours for Robina and Ethel, besides various lesser delights for
      the small fry, his own and the flock at Vale Leston, besides a cushion for
      Alda&rsquo;s sofa. John Inglesant had been bought by a connoisseur by special
      commission. He heard at every stall triumphant accounts of the grand
      outlay of the Travis Underwoods and Rotherwoods, and just the contrary of
      Mrs. Pettifer, whom he encountered going about in search of bargains, and
      heard haggling for a handsome table-cover, because it was quite aesthetic,
      and would not do except in a large house, so of course it had not sold.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Mouse-traps had been a great success, and there were very few left of
      them. They really owed as much to Lance as did the play, for he had not
      only printed them at as small a cost as possible, but had edited, pruned,
      and got them into shape more than any of the young lady authors suspected.
      The interpretation of handwriting had likewise succeeded in obtaining many
      clients, and a large pile of silver coins. Anna, who was hovering near,
      was delighted to show him that her sister Sophy&rsquo;s writing had been
      declared to indicate homely tastes, an affectionate disposition, great
      perspicuity of perception, much force of character; and Franceska&rsquo;s,
      scarcely yet formed, showed that she was affectionate, romantic, and, of
      all things in the world, fond of horses and of boating. Emilia&rsquo;s was held
      as a great blunder, for she was said to have an eye devoted to temporal
      advantages, also volatile, yet of great determination, triumphing over
      every obstacle, and in much danger of self-deception.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The triumph at least is true,&rdquo; said Anna, &ldquo;now she has her way about the
      nursing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has she? I did not know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she is to try it for a year, while Cousins Fernan and Marilda go out
      to their farm in the Rocky Mountains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then there was a little commotion, and a report came up that a boat
      had been run down and some one drowned. Somebody said, &ldquo;One of those
      acting last night&mdash;a buccaneer.&rdquo; Somebody else, &ldquo;A naval man.&rdquo; Then
      it was &ldquo;The Buccaneer Captain,&rdquo; and Mrs. Pettifer was exclaiming, &ldquo;Poor
      Captain Armytage! He was in our theatricals, I remember, but they thought
      him rather high. But he was a fine young man! Poor Captain Armytage!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lance had sufficient interests in those at sea to be anxious, and turned
      his steps to the gates to ascertain the facts, when he was overtaken by
      Gillian, with a hat hastily thrown over her snooded hair and Highland
      garb, hurrying along, and looking very white.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Underwood! Oh! did you hear who it was?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No certainty. I was going down to find out. You,&rdquo; as he saw her purpose,
      &ldquo;had better not come. There will be a great crowd. I will come back and
      tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no, I must. This is the short way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her hands trembled so that she could hardly undo the private fastening of
      Miss Mohun&rsquo;s garden, and she began to dash down the cliff steps. Just at
      the turn, where the stair-way was narrowest, Lance heard her exclaim, and
      saw that she had met face to face no other than Captain Armytage himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! is it?&rdquo; and she so tottered on the rocky step that the hand he had
      put out in greeting became a support, and a tender one, as Lance said
      (perhaps with a little <i>malice</i>)&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We heard that the Buccaneer Captain had come to grief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I?&rdquo; he laughed; and Gillian shook herself up, asking&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t you run down?&rdquo; seeing even as she spoke that not a drop of wet
      was traceable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me! What! did you think I was going to peril my life in a &lsquo;longshore
      concern like this?&rdquo; said he, with a merry laugh, betraying infinite
      pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But did nothing happen? Nobody drowned?&rdquo; she asked, half disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a mouse! A little chap, one of the fairies yesterday, tumbled off the
      sea-wall where he had no business to be, but he swam like a cork. We threw
      him a rope and hauled him up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wherewith he gave his arm to Gillian, who was still trembling, and clasped
      it so warmly that Lance thought it expedient to pass them as soon as
      possible and continue his journey on the staircase, giving a low whistle
      of amusement, and pausing to look out on the beautiful blue bay, crowded
      with the white sails of yachts and pleasure-boats, with brilliant festoons
      of little flags, and here and there the feather of steam from a launch. He
      could look, for he was feeling lighter of heart now that the communication
      was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps Lance would have been edified could he have heard the colloquy&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gillian! you do care for me after all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gillian tried to take her arm away and to say, &ldquo;Common humanity,&rdquo; but she
      did not get the words out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Confess that if it had been that fisher-boy, you would
      not be here now!&rdquo; and he kept tight the arm that she was going to take
      away. Her face was in a flame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well; and if&mdash;if it wasn&rsquo;t, you need not make such a fuss
      about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not when it is the first ray of hope you have afforded me, for the only
      joy of my life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never meant to afford&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you could not help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t! I never meant it. Oh dear! I never meant to be worried about
      troublesome things like this till I had got older, and learnt a great deal
      more; and now you want to upset it all. It is very&mdash;very
      disagreeable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you need not be upset!&rdquo; poor Ernley Armytage pleaded. &ldquo;Remember, I am
      going away for three years. May I not take hope with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gillian paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; again she said, &ldquo;I do like you&mdash;I mean, I don&rsquo;t mind you as
      much as most people; you have done something, and you have some sense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His look of rapture at these very moderate words quite overpowered her,
      and the tears welled up into her eyes, while she made a sudden change of
      tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, there&mdash;of course it is all right. I&rsquo;m a nasty creature, and
      if you like me, it is more than I deserve, only, whatever you do, don&rsquo;t
      make me cry. I&rsquo;ve got all the horrid dolls and pen-wipers, and bags and
      rags to get rid of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I talk to your mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, if you can catch her. She will be ever so much more good to you
      than I; and I only hope she will warn you what a Tartar I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wherewith Gillian threw off her hat, swung open the gate, and dashed like
      a hunted hare up to her mother&rsquo;s stall, where in truth she had been
      wanted, since only two helpers had remained to assist in the cheapening
      and final disposal of the remnants. Lady Merrifield read something in
      those wild eyes and cheeks burning, but the exigencies of the moment
      obliged her to hold her peace, and apply herself to estimating the
      half-price of the cushions and table-cloths she rejoiced to see departing,
      as well as to preserve wits enough not to let Gillian sell the Indian
      screen for two shillings and sixpence, under the impression that this was
      the half of five pounds. Mysie was the only one who kept her senses fairly
      undisturbed, and could balance between her duty to the schools and her
      desire to gratify a child, happy in that she never saw more than one thing
      at a time. Valetta and Primrose were yachting, so that the distraction was
      less, and Captain Armytage lingered round, taking messages, and looking in
      wistful earnestness for some one to be disengaged. Yet there was something
      in his eyes that spoke of the calmness of an attained object, and Miss
      Mohun, who had sold off all her remaining frocks and pinafores at a
      valuation to Marilda for some institution, and was free to help her
      sister, saw in a moment that his mind was settled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet speech was scarcely possible till the clearance was finally effected
      by a Dutch auction, when Captain Armytage distinguished himself
      unexpectedly as auctioneer, and made an end even of the last sachet,
      though it smelt so strongly of lip-salve that he declared that a bearer
      must be paid to take it away. But the purchaser was a big sailor, who
      evidently thought it an elegant gift for his sweetheart.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time it was gone the yachters had come home. Captain Armytage
      seized on Sir Jasper, who already know his purpose, and wished him
      success, though withheld from saying a word to urge the suit by Lady
      Merrifield&rsquo;s assurances, that to hurry Gillian&rsquo;s decision would be fatal
      to success, and that a reproof for petulance would be worse. She did not
      know whether to wish for the engagement or not; Gillian was her very dear
      and sufficient companion, more completely so than Mysie, who was far less
      clever; and she had sometimes doubted whether common domestic life
      beginning early was for the girl&rsquo;s happiness and full development; but she
      knew that her husband would scout these doubts as nonsense, and both
      really liked Ernley Armytage, and had heard nothing but what was to his
      advantage in every way, when they had been in his own county, and had seen
      his neighbours and his family. However, she could only keep quiet, and let
      her heart rise in a continual aspiration at every silent moment for her
      child&rsquo;s guidance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before she had had her moment of speech with either, she heard her husband
      calling Gillian, and she knew that he was the one person with whom his
      daughter never hid her true self in petulance or sarcasm. So Gillian met
      him in the General&rsquo;s sitting-room, gasping as she turned the handle of the
      door. He set a chair for her, and spoke gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I find you have gained the heart of a good man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure I never meant it,&rdquo; half whispered Gillian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that&mdash;you never meant it? I never supposed you capable of
      such an unladylike design. You mean that you were taken by surprise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I did see what he was at,&rdquo; and she hung her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You guessed his intentions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, papa; but I didn&rsquo;t want&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try to explain yourself,&rdquo; said Sir Jasper as she broke off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I did wish to go on improving myself and being useful. Surely it
      was not wrong, papa. Don&rsquo;t you see, I did not want to let myself be
      worried into letting myself go out, and spoiling all my happiness and
      improvement and work, and getting to care for somebody else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you have consented.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, when I was frightened for him I found I did care, and he got hold
      of me, and made me allow that I did; and now I suppose nobody will give me
      any peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay, Gillian&mdash;keep yourself from this impatient mood. I think I
      understand your unwillingness to overthrow old associations and admit a
      new overmastering feeling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it, papa,&rdquo; said Gillian, looking up. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear that
      overmastering feeling, nor the being told every one must come to it. It
      seems such folly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Folly that Eve was given to be a helpmeet, and as the bride, the Church
      to her Bridegroom? Look high enough, Gillian, and the popular chatter will
      not confuse your mind. You own that you really love him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, papa, not half so much as mamma, or Mysie, or Jasper, but&mdash;but I
      think I might.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all, Gillian? No one would coerce you. Shall I send him away, and
      tell him not to think of it? Remember, it is a serious thing&mdash;nay, an
      unworthy thing to trifle with a right-minded man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gillian sat clasping the elbow of her chair, her dark eyes fixed. At last
      she said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa, I do feel a sort of trust in him, a sort of feeling as if my life
      and all goodness and all that would be safe with him; and I couldn&rsquo;t bear
      him to go quite away and hear no more of him, only I do wish it wouldn&rsquo;t
      happen now; and if there is a fuss about it, I shall get cross and savage,
      and be as nasty as possible, I know I shall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t exercise enough self-command to remember what is due&mdash;I
      would say kind and considerate&mdash;to a man who has loved you through
      all your petulance and discouragement, and now is going to a life not
      without peril for three years? Suppose a mishap, Gillian&mdash;how would
      you feel as to your treatment of him on this last evening?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, papa! if you talk in that way I must, I must,&rdquo; and she burst into
      tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Jasper bent over her and gave her a kiss&mdash;a kiss that from him
      was something to remember. It was late, and summonses to a hurried meal
      were ringing through Beechcroft Cottage, where the Clipstone party waited
      to see the illuminations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Talk was eager between the sellers and the sailors as Valetta described
      the two parties, the fate of the Indian screen, and the misconduct of
      Cockneys in their launches were discussed by many a voice, but Gillian was
      unwontedly silent. Her mother had no time for more than a kiss before the
      shouts of Wilfred, Fergus, and Primrose warned them that the illuminations
      were beginning. She could only catch Mysie, and beg her to keep the
      younger ones away from Gillian and the Captain. Mysie opened her brown
      eyes wide and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Then, &ldquo;Is it really?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, my dear, and remember that it is his last evening!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Mysie again. &ldquo;I never thought it of Gill! May I tell Valetta?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better not, my dear, if it can be helped.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A screaming for Gill was heard, and Mysie hastened to answer it. Lady
      Merrifield was too much tired to do anything but sit in the garden with
      Miss Mohun and look out at the ships, glittering with festoons of coloured
      lamps, reflected in the sea, but the young people went further afield, out
      on the cliff path to Rotherwood Park. The populace were mainly collected
      on the quay, and this formed a more select promenade, though by no means
      absolute solitude. Sir Jasper really did keep guard over the path along
      which Gillian allowed her Captain to conduct her, not exactly knowing
      which way they were going, and quite away from the bay and all its
      attractions.
    </p>
    <p>
      She heard him out without any of the sharp, impatient answers in which her
      maiden coyness was wont to disguise itself, as he told her of his hopes
      and plans for the time when his three years of the Mediterranean should be
      over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you see you can go on studying all the time, if you must be so
      clever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think one ought to make the most of oneself, just as you want to rise
      in your profession! No, indeed, I could not bear you if you wanted me to
      sit down and idle, or to dawdle yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t grow too clever for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother always says that a real man has stuff in him that is quite
      different from cleverness, and yet I could not bear to give that up. I am
      so glad you don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mind! I mind nothing but to know you are caring for me. And you will
      write to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t know what to say. You will tell of volcanoes, and Athens, and
      Constantinople, and Egypt, and the Holy Land, and I shall have nothing to
      say but who lectures in college.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little you know what that will be to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a curious sensation all the time to Gillian, with a dawning sense
      that was hardly yet love&mdash;she was afraid of that&mdash;but of
      something good and brave and worthy that had become hers. She had felt
      something analogous when the big deer-hound at Stokesley came and put his
      head upon her lap. But the hound showed himself grateful for caresses, and
      so did her present giant when the road grew rough, and she let him draw
      her arm into his and talk to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the parting, for he had to go to London and to his own family the
      next day early. Gillian spoke not a word all through the dark drive to
      Clipstone, but when the party emerged into the light her eyes were full of
      tears. Lady Merrifield followed her to her room, and her words half choked
      were&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma, I never knew what a great, solemn, holy thing <i>it</i> is. Will
      you look me out a prayer to help me to get worthy?&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII. &mdash; ILLUMINATIONS
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &lsquo;Twas in the summer-time so sweet,
        When hearts and flowers are both in season,
      That who, of all the world should meet,
        In &ldquo;twilight eve,&rdquo; but Love and Reason.
                                         T. MOORE.
</pre>
    <p>
      That moon and sparkling lights did not shine alone for Gerald and Dolores.
      There were multitudes on the cliffs and the beach, and Sir Ferdinand and
      Lady Travis Underwood with their party had come to an irregular sort of
      dinner-supper at St. Andrew&rsquo;s Rock. With them, or rather before them, came
      Mr. Bramshaw, the engineer, who sent in his card to Mr. Clement Underwood,
      and entered with a leathern bag, betraying the designs on Penbeacon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not that these were more than an introduction. Indeed, under the present
      circumstances, a definite answer was impossible; but there was another
      question, namely, that which regarded Sophia Vanderkist. She had indeed
      long been of age, but of course her suitor could not but look to her
      former guardian for consent and influence. He was a very bearded man,
      pleasant-spoken and gentlemanlike, and Lancelot had prepared his brother
      by saying that he knew all about the family, and they were highly
      respectable solicitors at Minsterham, one son a master in the school at
      Stoneborough. So Clement listened favourably, liked the young man, and
      though his fortunes at present depended on his work, and Lady Vanderkist
      was no friend to his suit, gave him fair encouragement, and invited him to
      join the meal, though the party was already likely to be too numerous for
      the dining-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      That mattered the less when all the young and noisy ones could be placed,
      to their great delight, under the verandah outside, where they could talk
      and laugh to their utmost content, without incommoding Uncle Clement, or
      being awed by Cousin Fernan&rsquo;s black beard and Cacique-like gravity. How
      they discussed and made fun over the humours of the bazaar; nor was
      Gerald&rsquo;s wit the slackest, nor his mirth the most lagging. He was very far
      from depressed now that the first shock was over. He knew himself to be as
      much loved or better than ever by those whose affection he valued, and he
      was sure of Dolores&rsquo; heart as he had never yet been. The latent
      Bohemianism in his nature woke with the prospect of having his own way to
      make, and being free from the responsibilities of an estate, and his
      chivalry was excited by the pleasure of protecting his little half-sister,
      in pursuit of whom he intended to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, light-hearted enough to amaze the elders who knew the secret, he
      jumped up to go with the rest of the party to the cliff walk, where the
      brilliant ships could best be seen. Lance, though his headache was, as
      Geraldine said, visible on his brow, declared that night air and
      sea-breeze were the best remedy, and went in charge of the two boys, lest
      his dainty Ariel should make an excursion over the rocks; and the four
      young ladies were escorted by Gerald and the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The elders were much too tired for further adventures, and Geraldine and
      Marilda were too intimate to feel bound to talk. Only a few words dropped
      now and then about Emilia and her hospital, where she was to be left for a
      year, while Fernan with Marilda visited his American establishments, and
      on their return would decide whether she would return, or whether they
      would take Franceska, or a younger one, in her stead. The desertion put
      Marilda out of heart, and she sighed what a pity it was that the girl
      would not listen to young Brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Clement was making Ferdinand go over with him Edgar&rsquo;s words
      about his marriage. They had all been written down immediately after his
      death, and had been given to Felix with the certificates of the marriage
      and birth and of the divorce, and they were now no doubt with other
      documents and deeds in the strong-box at Vale Leston Priory. Fernan could
      only repeat the words which had been burnt in on his memory, and promise
      to hunt up the evidence of the form and manner of the dissolution of the
      marriage at Chicago. Like Clement himself, he very much doubted whether
      the allegation would not break down in some important point, but he wished
      Gerald to be assured that if the worst came to the worst, he would never
      be left destitute, since that first meeting&mdash;the baptism, and the
      receiving him from the dying father&mdash;amounted to an adoption sacred
      in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, seeing how worn-out Clement looked, he abetted Sibby and Geraldine,
      in shutting their patient safe up in his bedroom, not to be &ldquo;mislested&rdquo;
       any more that night, said Sibby. So he missed the rush of the return.
      First came the two sober sisters, Anna and Emilia, only sorry that Aunt
      Cherry had not seen the lovely sea, the exquisite twinkle of silvered
      waves as the moon rose, and then the outburst of coloured lights, taking
      many forms, and the brilliant fireworks darting to and fro, describing
      curves, bursting and scattering their sparks. Emilia had, however, begun
      by the anxious question&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nan, what is it with Gerald?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite know. I suspect Dolores has somehow teased him, though it
      is not like her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there is something in it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help believing so, but I don&rsquo;t believe it has come to anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is she not a most disagreeable girl! Those black eyebrows do look so
      sullen and thunderous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no, Emmie, I thought so at first, but she can&rsquo;t help her eyebrows; and
      when you come to know her there is a vast deal in her&mdash;thought, and
      originality, and purpose. I am sure it has been good for Gerald. He has
      seemed more definite and in earnest lately, less as if he were playing
      with everything, with all views all round.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But his spirits are so odd!&mdash;so merry and then so grave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is only during these last few days, and I fancy there must be some
      hitch&mdash;perhaps about Dolores&rsquo; father, and we are all in such haste.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emilia did not pursue the subject. She had never indulged in the folly of
      expecting any signs of actual love from her cousin. She had always known
      that the family regarded any closer bond as impossible; but she had been
      always used to be his chief confidante, and she missed his attention, but
      she would not own this even to herself, go she talked of her hospital
      schemes with much zest, and how she should spend her outings at a
      favourite sisterhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I am tired of luxury.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It had been a delightful walk to Anna, with her companion sister,
      discussing Adrian, or Emily&rsquo;s plans, or Sophy&rsquo;s prospects. They had come
      home the sooner, for Emily had to pack, as she was to spend a little while
      with her mother at Vale Leston. Where was Franceska? They were somewhat
      dismayed not to find her, but it was one of the nights when everybody
      loses everybody, and no doubt she was with Uncle Lance, or with Sophy, or
      Gerald.
    </p>
    <p>
      No such thing. Here was Uncle Lance with his two boys in varying kinds of
      delight, Adrian pronouncing that &ldquo;it was very jolly, the most ripping
      sight he ever saw,&rdquo; then eating voraciously, with his eyes half shut, and
      tumbling off to bed &ldquo;like a veritable Dutchman,&rdquo; said Lance, who had his
      own son in a very different mood, with glowing cheeks, sparkling eyes,
      appetite gone for very excitement, as he sprang about and waved his hands
      to describe the beautiful course of the rockets, and the fall of the stars
      from the Roman candles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, such as I never&mdash;never saw! How shall I get Pearl and Audrey to
      get even a notion of it? Grandpapa will guess in a moment! Oh, and the
      sea, all shine with a path of&mdash;of glory! Oh, daddy, there are things
      more beautiful than anybody could ever dream of!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go and dream then, my sprite. Try to be as still as you can, even if you
      do go on feeling the yacht, and seeing the sparks when you shut your eyes.
      For you see my head is bad, and I do want a chance of sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor daddy! I&rsquo;ll try, even if the music goes on in my head. Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will keep him quieter than anything,&rdquo; said Lance; &ldquo;but I would not
      give much for the chance of his not seeing the dawn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or you either, I fear,&rdquo; said Geraldine. &ldquo;Have you slept since the
      discovery?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall make my sleep up at home, now I have had the whole out. Who comes
      now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Sophy, with her look of
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;Gentle wishes long subdued,
           Subdued and cherished long.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Mr. Bramshaw had brought her to the door, and no doubt she and he had had
      a quiet, restful time of patient planning; but the not finding Francie
      soon filled her with great alarm and self-reproach for having let herself
      be drawn away from the party, when all had stood together on Miss Mohun&rsquo;s
      lawn. She wanted to start off at once in search of her sister, and was
      hardly pacified by finding that Gerald was still to come. Then, however,
      Gerald did come, and alone. He said he had just seen the Clipstone party
      off. No, he had not seen Francie there; but he added, rather as if
      recovering from a bewilderment, as Sophy was asking him to come out with
      her again, &ldquo;Oh, never fear. Lord Ivinghoe was there somewhere!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought he was gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he said the yacht got in too late for the train. Never mind, Sophy,
      depend upon it she is all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      None of the ladies present felt equally pleased, but in a minute or two
      more in came a creature, bright, lovely, and flushed, with two starry
      eyes, gleaming like the blue lights on the ships.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Cousin Marilda, have I kept you waiting? I am so sorry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where have you been?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only on the cliff walk. Lord Ivinghoe took me to see the place where his
      father had the accident, and we watched the fireworks from there. Oh, it
      was so nice, and still more beautiful when the strange lights were out and
      the people gone, and only the lovely quiet moon shining on the sea, and a
      path of light from Venus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think so,&rdquo; muttered Gerald, and Marilda began&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty well, miss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very sorry to bo so late,&rdquo; began Francie, and Geraldine caught an
      opportunity while shawling Marilda to say&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear, good Marilda, I implore you to say nothing to put it into her head
      or Alda&rsquo;s. I don&rsquo;t think any harm is done yet, but it can&rsquo;t be anything.
      It can&rsquo;t come to good, and it would only be unhappiness to them all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, ah! well, I&rsquo;ll try. But what a chance it would be, and how happy it
      would make poor Alda!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be. The boy&rsquo;s mother would never let him look at her! Don&rsquo;t,
      don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll try not.&rdquo; She kissed her fondly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gerald&rsquo;s walk had been with Dolores of course, a quiet, grave, earnest
      talk and walk, making them feel how much they belonged to one another, and
      building schemes in which they were to learn the nature of the poor and
      hard-worked, by veritably belonging to them, and being thus able to be of
      real benefit. In truth, neither of them, in their brave youthfulness,
      really regretted Vale Leston, and the responsibilities; and, as Gerald
      declared, he would give it up tomorrow gladly if he could save his name
      and his father&rsquo;s from shame, but, alas! the things went together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dolores wished to write fully to her father, and that Gerald should do the
      same, but she did not wish to have the matter discussed in the family at
      once, before his answer came, and Gerald had agreed to silence, as indeed
      they would not call themselves engaged till that time. Indeed, Dolores
      said there was so much excitement about Captain Armytage that no one was
      thinking of her.

      CHAPTER XXIV. &mdash; COUNSELS OF PATIENCE
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     He either fears his fate too much,
       Or his deserts are small,
     Who fears to put it to the touch,
       To win or lose it all.
</pre>
    <p>
      If Sibby hoped to keep her &ldquo;long boy&rdquo; from being &ldquo;mislested,&rdquo; she was
      mistaken. He knew too well what was to come, and when she knocked at his
      door with his cup of tea, he came to it half dressed, to her extreme
      indignation, calling for his shaving water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Master Clem, if you would only be insinsed enough to keep to your
      bed, you might have Miss Sophy to speak to you there, if nothing else will
      serve you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In coorse, and Miss Francie too. What should they do else, after
      colloguing with their young men all night? Ah, &lsquo;tis a proud woman poor
      Miss Alda would be if she could have seen the young lord! And the real
      beauty is Miss Francie, such as my own babbies were before her, bless
      them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; cried Clement in consternation. &ldquo;It is only a bit of passing
      admiration. Don&rsquo;t say a word about it to the others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As if I would demane myself to the like of them! Me that has been
      forty-seven years with you and yours, and had every one of you in my arms
      the first thing, except the blessed eldest that is gone to a better
      place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would that he were here now!&rdquo; sighed Clement, almost as he had sighed
      that first morning of his loss. &ldquo;Where are those girls?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rampaging over the house with Sir Adrian, and his packing of all his
      rubbish, enough to break the heart of a coal-heaver! I&rsquo;d not let them in
      to bother their aunt, and Mr. Gerald is asleep like a blessed baby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Lance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! it is down to the sea he is with that child that looks as if he was
      made of air, and lived on live larks! And Master Lance, he&rsquo;s no better&mdash;eats
      like a sparrow, and sits up half the night writing for his paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clement got rid of Sibby at last, but he was hardly out of his room before
      Sophy descended on him, anxious and blushing, though he could give her
      much sympathy and kindly hope of his influence, only he had to preach
      patience. It had been no hasty fancy, but there had long been growing
      esteem and affection, and he could assure her of all the aid the family
      could give with her mother, though Penbeacon works would be a very
      insecure foundation for hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think Gerald would consent,&rdquo; said Sophy, &ldquo;and he will soon be of age.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clement could only say &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One thing I hope is not wrong,&rdquo; said Sophy, &ldquo;but I do trust that no one
      will tell mother about Lord Ivinghoe. It is not jealousy, I hope, but I
      cannot see that there is anything in it, only the very sound would set
      mother more against Philip than ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not suppose that Francie is&mdash;is touched?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Sophy, gravely as an elder, &ldquo;she is such a child. She was very
      much pleased and entertained, and went on chattering, till I begged her to
      let us say our prayers in peace. We never talk after that, and she went to
      sleep directly, and was smiling when she woke, but I do not fancy she will
      dwell on it, or fancy there is more to come, unless some one puts it into
      her head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was sagely said, and Clement knew pretty well who was the one person
      from whom Sophy had fears. Poor Alda, improved and altered as she was, if
      such a hope occurred to her, would she be able to help imparting it to her
      daughter and looking out for the fulfilment?
    </p>
    <p>
      Loud calls for Sophy rang through the house, and Clement had only time to
      add&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Patience, dear child, and submission. They not only win the day, but are
      the best preparation for it when it is won.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That family of girls had grown up to be a care to one who had trusted that
      his calling would be a shield from worldly concerns; but he accepted it as
      providential, and as a trust imposed on him as certainly as Felix had felt
      the headship of the orphaned house.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was rejoiced to find on coming down-stairs that Lance had decided on
      giving another day to family counsels, sending off little Felix with his
      cousins, who would drop him at the junction to Stoneborough, whence he
      would be proud to travel alone. Clement took another resolution, in virtue
      of which he knocked at his sister&rsquo;s door before she went down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cherry,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;would it be inconvenient to keep Francie here just for
      the present?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all; it would be only too pleasant for Anna now that she loses her
      brother. But why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to hinder her from hearing the conclusions that her mother may
      draw from the diversions of yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see. It might soon be,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &lsquo;He cometh not, she said.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Sophy will keep her counsel as to those moonlight wanderings. When
      were they to go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the 11.30 train. Marilda is coming up first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So the plan was propounded. Franceska was only too much charmed to stay in
      what had indeed been an enchanted coast to her, and Sophy was sure that
      mamma would not mind; so the matter was settled, and the explanatory notes
      written.
    </p>
    <p>
      The party set off, with each little boy hugging a ship in full sail, and
      the two young sisters were disposed of by a walk to Clipstone to talk over
      their adventures. Mrs. Grinstead felt certain of the good manners and
      reticence prevailing there to prevent any banter about Lord Ivinghoe, and
      she secured the matter further by a hint to Anna.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, Miss Mohun was announced almost as they left the house. She too
      was full of the bazaar, which seemed so long ago to her hearers, but with
      the result of which she was exceedingly delighted. The voluntary schools
      were secured for the present, and the gratitude of the Church folk was
      unbounded, especially to the Vale Leston family, who had contributed so
      greatly to the success of the whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane too had watched the evening manoeuvres, and perceived, with her sharp
      eyes, all that was avowed and not avowed under that rising moon. The pair
      of whom she had first to speak were &ldquo;Ivanhoe and Rowena,&rdquo; as she called
      them, and she was glad to find that the &ldquo;fair Saxon&rdquo; had grown up at Vale
      Leston, educated by her aunt and sister, and imbibing no outside habits or
      impressions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor child,&rdquo; said Jane, &ldquo;she looks like a flower; one is sorry it should
      be meddled with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So did my sister Stella, and there, contrary to all our fears, the course
      of true love did run smooth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it depended entirely on Rotherwood himself, I think it would,&rdquo; said
      Jane, &ldquo;but&mdash;&rdquo; She paused and went on, &ldquo;Ivinghoe is, I fear, really
      volage, and he is the mark of a good many London mammas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it true about Mrs. Henderson&rsquo;s sister?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing in it. I believe he danced with her a few times, and the
      silly little thing put her own construction on it, but her sister made her
      confess that he had never said a word to her, nor made love in any sense.
      Indeed, my sister Adeline would never have consented to her coming here if
      she had believed in it, but Maura has a Greek nature and turns the Whites
      round her fingers. Well, I hope all will go well with your pretty
      Franceska. I should not like her lovely bloom to be faded by Ivinghoe. He
      is Rotherwood&rsquo;s own boy, though rather a prig, and a man in London. Oh,
      you know what that means!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have done <i>notre possible</i> to keep our interpretation from the
      poor child, or any hint of it from reaching her mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Poor Rowena, I hope the spark will be blown out, or remain
      only a pleasant recollection. As to little Maura, she had her lesson when
      she was reduced to hanging on Captain Henderson&rsquo;s other arm! She is off
      to-day to meet Mr. White in London. That purpose has been served.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And have you not a nearer interest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Gillian! Well, Captain Armytage did get hold of her, in what we must
      now call the Lover&rsquo;s Walk! Yes, she has yielded, to her father&rsquo;s great
      satisfaction and perhaps to her mother&rsquo;s, for she will be more comfortable
      in looking forward to a commonplace life for her than in the dread of
      modern aberrations. But Gillian is very funny, very much ashamed of having
      given in, and perfectly determined to go to her college and finish her
      education, which she may as well do while the Sparrow Hawk is at sea. He
      is off to-day, and she says she is very glad to be rid of him. She sat
      down at once to her dynamite, as Primrose calls it, having bound over
      Mysie and Valetta never to mention the subject! I tell them that to obey
      in silence is the way to serve the poor man best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Mohun was interrupted by the announcement of Lady Flight and Mr.
      Flight, who came equally eager with delight and gratitude to thank the
      House of Underwood for the triumph. The rest of the clergy of Rockquay and
      half the ladies might be expected, and in despair at last of a &ldquo;lucid
      interval,&rdquo; Geraldine ordered the carriage for a long drive into the
      country, so as to escape all visitors. Even then, they could not got up
      the hill without being stopped four or five times to receive the thanks
      and compliments which nearly drove Gerald crazy, so much did he want to
      hear what his family had to say to his plans, that he had actually
      consented to partake of a dowager-drive in a landau!
    </p>
    <p>
      He and his uncle had discovered from the police in the course of the
      morning that Ludmilla and her mother had not gone with the circus, but had
      been seen embarking in the Alice Jane, a vessel bound for London. His idea
      had been to hurry thither and endeavour to search out his half-sister, and
      rescue her; but Lance had assured him not only that it would probably be a
      vain quest, but that there would be full time to meet the Alice Jane by
      land before she could get there by sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this he had yielded, but not so readily to the representation that the
      wisest way would be to keep out of sight; but to let Lance, as a less
      interested party, go and interview the van proprietor, whose direction had
      been sent to Clement, try to see O&rsquo;Leary, and do his best to bargain for
      Ludmilla&rsquo;s release, a matter on which all were decided, whatever might be
      the upshot of the question respecting Gerald. To leave a poor girl to
      circus training, even if there were no interest in her, would have been
      shocking to right-minded people; but when it was such a circus as
      O&rsquo;Leary&rsquo;s, and the maiden was so good, sweet, and modest as Lida, the
      thought would have been intolerable even without the connection with
      Gerald, who had been much taken with all he had seen of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is fixed, even if we have to bid high for our Mona,&rdquo; said Lance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By all means,&rdquo; said Geraldine. &ldquo;It will be another question what will be
      good for her when we have got her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will take care of that!&rdquo; said Gerald.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Next,&rdquo; Lance went on, &ldquo;we must see what proofs, or if there be any, of
      this person&rsquo;s story. I expect one of you will have to pay well for them,
      but I had better take a lawyer with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clement named the solicitor who had the charge of the Vanderkist affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better than Staples, or Bramshaw &amp; Anderson. Yes, it would be best to
      have no previous knowledge of the family, and no neighbourly acquaintance.
      Moreover, I am not exactly an interested party, so I may be better
      attended to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still I very much doubt, even if you do get any statement from the woman,
      whether it can be depended upon without verification,&rdquo; said Clement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the registers, if there are any at these places?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly, and there must be personal inquiry. The first husband, Gian
      Benista, will have to be hunted down, dead or alive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and another thing,&rdquo; said Lance, &ldquo;if the Italian marriage were before
      the revolution in Sicily, I expect the ecclesiastical ceremony would be
      valid, but after that, the civil marriage would be required.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; groaned Gerald, &ldquo;if you would let me throw it all up without these
      wretched quibbles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not your father&rsquo;s honour,&rdquo; said his aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor our honesty,&rdquo; said Clement. &ldquo;It is galling enough to have your whole
      position in life depend on the word of a worthless woman, but there are
      things that must be taken patiently, as the will of One who knows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is so hard to accept it as God&rsquo;s will when it comes of human sin,&rdquo;
       said Geraldine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Human thoughtlessness,&rdquo; said Clement; &ldquo;but as long as it is not by our
      own fault we can take it as providential, and above all, guard against
      impatience, the real ruin and destruction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Lance, &ldquo;sit on a horse&rsquo;s head when he is down to keep him from
      kicking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you all are sitting on my head,&rdquo; said Gerald; &ldquo;I shall get out and
      walk&mdash;a good rush on the moors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait at least to allow your head to take in my scheme,&rdquo; said Clement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Provided it is not sitting still,&rdquo; said Gerald.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Far from it. Only it partly depends on my lady and mistress here&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess,&rdquo; said Geraldine. &ldquo;You know I am disposed that way by Dr.
      Brownlow&rsquo;s verdict.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And &lsquo;that way&rsquo; is that we go ourselves to try to trace out this strange
      allegation&mdash;you coming too, Gerald, so that we shall not quite be
      sitting on your head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But my sister?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will see when we have recovered her,&rdquo; said Mrs. Grinstead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would begin with a visit to Stella and her husband,&rdquo; said Clement;
      &ldquo;Charlie could put us in the way of dealing with consuls and
      vice-consuls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellent,&rdquo; cried his sister; &ldquo;Anna goes of course, and I should like to
      take Francie. It would be such an education for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is to become of Adrian?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we should not have been here more than six months of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could take him,&rdquo; said Lance, &ldquo;unless Alda holds poor old Froggatt &amp;
      Underwood beneath his dignity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That can be considered,&rdquo; said Clement; &ldquo;it approves itself best to me,
      except that he is getting on so well here that I don&rsquo;t like to disturb
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when can you come up to town with me?&rdquo; demanded Gerald; &ldquo;tomorrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow being Saturday, it would be of little use to go. No, if you
      will not kick, master, I must go home to-morrow, and look up poor &lsquo;Pur,&rsquo; 
      also the organ on Sunday. Come with me, and renew your acquaintance. We
      will make an appointment with your attorney, Clem, and run up on Monday
      evening, see him on Tuesday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gerald sighed, submitting perforce, and they let him out to exhale as much
      impatience as he could in a tramp over the hills, while they sat and
      pitied him from their very hearts.

      CHAPTER XXV. &mdash; DESDICHADO
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &lsquo;Perish wealth and power and pride,
        Mortal boons by mortals given;
      But let constancy abide&mdash;
        Constancy&rsquo;s the gift of Heaven.&mdash;SCOTT.
</pre>
    <p>
      Lancelot and Gerald did not obtain much by their journey to London. Gerald
      wanted to begin with Mr. Bast, van proprietor, but Lance insisted on
      having the lawyer&rsquo;s counsel first, and the advice amounted to exhortations
      not to commit themselves, or to make offers such as to excite cupidity,
      especially in the matter of Ludmilla, but to dwell on the fact of her
      being so close to the age of emancipation, and the illegality of
      tyrannical training.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, however, proved to be wasted advice. Mr. Bast was impervious. He
      undertook to forward a letter to Mr. O&rsquo;Leary, but would not tell where,
      nor whether wife and daughter were with him. The letter was written, and
      in due time was answered, but with an intimation that the information
      desired could only be given upon the terms already mentioned; and refusing
      all transactions respecting the young lady mentioned, who was with her
      natural guardians and in no need of intervention.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were baffled at all points, and the lawyer did not encourage any idea
      of holding out a lure for information, which might easily be trumped up.
      Since Lancelot had discovered so much as that the first marriage had taken
      place at Messina, and the desertion at Trieste, as well as that the
      husband was said to have been a native of Piedmont, he much recommended
      personal investigation at all these points, especially as Mr. Underwood
      could obtain the assistance and interest of consuls. It was likely that if
      neither uncle nor nephew made further demonstration, the O&rsquo;Learys would
      attempt further communication, which he and Lance could follow up. This
      might be a clue to finding &ldquo;the young lady&rdquo;&mdash;to him a secondary
      matter, to Gerald a vital one, but for the present nothing could be done
      for her, poor child.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they could only return to Rockquay to make immediate preparations for
      the journey. Matters were simplified by Miss Mohun, who, hearing that
      Clement&rsquo;s doctors ordered him abroad for the winter, came to the rescue,
      saying that she should miss Fergus and his lessons greatly, and she
      thought it would be a pity for Mrs. Edgar to lose their little baronet,
      just after having given offence to certain inhabitants by a modified
      expulsion of Campbell and Horner, and therefore volunteering to take
      Adrian for a few terms, look after his health, his morals, and his
      lessons, and treat him in fact like a nephew, &ldquo;to keep her hand in,&rdquo; she
      said, &ldquo;till the infants began to appear from India.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was gratefully accepted, and Alda liked the plan better than placing
      him at Bexley, which she continued to regard as an unwholesome place. The
      proposal to take Franceska was likewise welcome, and the damsel herself
      was in transports of delight. Various arrangements had to be made, and it
      was far on in August that the farewells were exchanged with Clipstone and
      Beechcroft Cottage, where each member of the party felt that a real friend
      had been acquired. The elders, ladies who had grown up in an enthusiastic
      age, were even more devoted to one another than were Anna and Mysie.
      Gillian stood a little aloof, resolved against &ldquo;foolish&rdquo; confidences, and
      devoting herself to studies for college life, in which she tried to
      swallow up all the feelings excited by those ship letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dolores had her secret, which was to be no longer a secret when she had
      heard from her father, and in the meantime, with Gerald&rsquo;s full
      concurrence, she was about to work hard to qualify herself for lecturing
      or giving lessons on physical science. She could not enter the college
      that she wished for till the winter term, and meant to spend the autumn in
      severe study.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will work,&rdquo; was the substance of those last words between them, and
      their parting tokens were characteristic, each giving the other a little
      case of mathematical instruments, &ldquo;We will work, and we will hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what for?&rdquo; said Dolores.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say for toil, if it could be with untarnished name,&rdquo; said
      Gerald.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Name and fame are our own to make,&rdquo; said Dolores, with sparkling eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was their parting. Indeed they expected to meet at Christmas or
      before it, so soon as Mr. Maurice Mohun should have written. Gerald was,
      by the unanimous wish of his uncles, to finish his terms at Oxford.
      Whatever might be his fate, a degree would help him in life.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had accepted the decision, though he had rather have employed the time
      in a restless search for his mother and sister; but after vainly pursuing
      two or three entertainments at fairs, he became amenable to the conviction
      that they were more likely to hear something if they gave up the search
      and kept quiet, and both Dolores and Mrs. Henderson promised to be on the
      watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      The state of suspense proved an admirable tonic to the whole being of the
      young man. His listlessness had departed, and he did everything with an
      energy he had never shown before. Only nothing would induce him to go near
      Vale Leston, and he made it understood that his twenty-first birthday was
      to be unnoticed. Not a word passed between Gerald and his aunt as to the
      cause of the journey, and the doubt that hung over him, but nothing could
      be more assiduous and tender than his whole conduct to her and his uncle
      throughout the journey, as though he had no object in life but to save
      them trouble and make them comfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The party started in August, travelled very slowly, and he was the kindest
      squire to the two girls, taking them to see everything, and being
      altogether, as Geraldine said, the most admirable courier in the world,
      with a wonderful intuition as to what she individually would like to see,
      and how she could see it without fatigue. Moreover, on the Sunday that
      occurred at a little German town, it was the greatest joy to her that he
      sought no outside gaiety, but rather seemed to cling to his uncle&rsquo;s home
      ministrations, and even to her readings of hymns. They had a quiet walk
      together, and it was a day of peace when his gentle kindness put her in
      mind of his father, yet with a regretful depth she had always missed in
      Edgar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was there any of that old dreary, half-contemptuous tone and manner
      which had often made her think he was only conforming to please her, and
      shrinking from coming to close quarters, where he might confess opinions
      that would grieve her. He was manifestly in earnest, listening and joining
      in the services as if they had a new force to him. Perhaps they had the
      more from the very absence of the ordinary externals, and with nothing to
      disturb the individual personality of Clement&rsquo;s low, earnest, and reverent
      tones. There were tears on his eyelashes as he rose up, bent over, and
      kissed his Cherie. And that evening, while Clement and the two nieces
      walked farther, and listened to the Benediction in the little Austrian
      church, Gerald sat under a linden-tree with his aunt, and in the fullness
      of his heart told her how things stood between him and Dolores.
    </p>
    <p>
      Geraldine had never been as much attracted by Dolores as by Gillian and
      Mysie, but she was greatly touched by hearing that the meeting and opening
      of affection had been on the discovery that Gerald was probably nameless
      and landless, and that the maiden was bent on casting in her lot with him
      whatever his fate might be.
    </p>
    <p>
      He murmured to himself the old lines, with a slight alteration&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;I could not love thee, dear, so much,
             Loved I not justice more.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed, Cherie, our affection is a very different and better thing
      than it would be if I were only the rich young squire sure of my
      position.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure it is, my dear. I honour and love her for being my boy&rsquo;s brave
      comforter&mdash;comforter in the true sense. I see now what has helped you
      to be so brave and cheery. But what will her father say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will probably be startled, and&mdash;and will object, but it would be
      a matter of waiting anyway, the patience that the Vicar preaches, and we
      have made up our minds. I&rsquo;ll fight my own way; she to prepare by her
      Cambridge course to come and work with me, as we can do so much better
      among the people&mdash;among them in reality, and by no pretence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! don&rsquo;t speak as if you gave up your cause.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I won&rsquo;t, if you don&rsquo;t like to hear it, Cherie,&rdquo; he said, smiling;
      &ldquo;but anyway you will be good to Dolores.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I will do my best, my dear. I am sure you and she, whatever
      happens, have the earnest purpose and soul to do all the good you can,
      whether from above or on the same level, and that makes the oneness of
      love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Cherie carissima. You see the secret of our true bond.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One bond to make it deeper must be there. The love of God beneath the
      love of man.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXVI. &mdash; THE SILENT STAR
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Then the traveller in the dark
     Thanks you for your tiny spark;
     He would not know which way to go
     If you did not twinkle so.&mdash;JANE TAYLOR.
</pre>
    <p>
      And so they came to Buda, where Charles Audley represented English
      diplomatic interests on the banks of the Danube. When the quaint old
      semi-oriental-looking city came in sight and the train stopped, the neat
      English-looking carriage, with gay Hungarian postillions, could be seen
      drawn up to meet them outside the station.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles and his father, now Sir Robert, were receiving them with
      outstretched hands and joyous words, and in a few seconds more they were
      with their little Stella! Yes, their little Stella still, as Clement and
      Cherry had time to see, when Gerald and the two girls had insisted on
      walking, however far it might be, with the two Audleys, though Charlie
      told them that no one ever walked in Hungary who could help it, and that
      he should be stared at for bringing such strange animals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Geraldine had stayed with Stella once before, and Clement had made one
      hurried and distressful rush in the trouble about Angela; but that was at
      Munich, and nearly nine years ago, before the many changes and chances of
      life had come to them. To Stella those years had brought two little boys,
      whose appearance in the world had been delayed till the Audley family had
      begun to get anxious for an heir, but while the Underwoods thought it was
      well that their parents, especially their father, should have time to grow
      a little older.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Stella looked as daintily, delicately pretty as ever, at first sight
      like a china shepherdess to be put under a glass shade, but on a second
      view, with a thoughtful sweetness and depth in her face that made her not
      merely pretty but lovely. How happy she was, gazing at her brother and
      sister, and now and then putting a question to bring out the overflow of
      home news, so dear to her. For she was still their silent star, making
      very few words evince her intense interest and sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even when they were at home, in the house that looked outside like a
      castle in a romance, but which was so truly English within, and the two
      little fellows of four and three came toddling to meet her, shrinking into
      her skirts at sight of the new uncle and aunt, there was a quiet gentle
      firmness&mdash;all the old Stella&mdash;in her dealings with them, as she
      drew them to kiss and greet the strangers. Robbie and Theodore were
      sturdy, rosy beings, full of life, but perfectly amenable to that sweet
      low voice. Their father and grandfather might romp with them to screaming
      pitch, and idolize them almost to spoiling, yet they too were under that
      gentle check which the young wife exercised on all around.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was only thirty-one, and so small, so fair and young in looks, that to
      her elder sister her pretty matronly rule <i>would</i> at first seem like
      the management of a dolls&rsquo; house, even though her servants, English,
      German, or Magyar, obeyed her implicitly; and for that matter, as Charlie
      and Sir Robert freely and merrily avowed, so did they. The young secretary
      was her bounden slave, and held her as the ideal woman, though there came
      to be a little swerving of his allegiance towards the tall and beautiful
      Franceska, who had insensibly improved greatly in grace and readiness on
      her travels, and quite dazzled the Hungarians; while Anna was immensely
      exultant, and used to come to her aunt&rsquo;s room every night to talk of her
      lovely Francie as a safety-valve from discussing the matter with Francie
      herself, who remained perfectly simple and unconscious of her own charms.
      Geraldine could not think them quite equal to the more exquisite and
      delicately-finished, as well as more matured, beauty of little Stella, but
      that was a matter of taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      The household was more English than Hungarian, or even German, and there
      were curious similitudes to the Vale Leston Priory arrangements, which
      kept Stella&rsquo;s Underwood heart in mind. There had to be receptions, and it
      was plain that when she put Fernan&rsquo;s diamonds on, Mrs. Audley was quite at
      home and at perfect ease in German and Hungarian society, speaking the
      languages without hesitation when she <i>did</i> speak, while in her quiet
      way keeping every one entertained, showing the art de tenir un salon, and
      moreover, preserving Francie from obtrusive admiration in a way perhaps
      learnt by experience on that more perilous subject, Angela, who had
      invited what Francie shrank from. The two girls were supremely happy, and
      Francie seemed to have a fountain of joy that diffused a rose-coloured
      spray over everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the famous concerts of Hungarian gipsies was given, and in that
      Clement and Geraldine were alike startled by tones recalling those of the
      memorable concert at Bexley, all the more because they seemed to have a
      curious fascination for Gerald. Moreover, those peculiar eyes and
      eyelashes, the first link observed between him and the Little Butterfly,
      were so often repeated in the gipsy band that it was plain whence they
      were derived. Charles Audley thought it worth while to find means of
      inquiry among the gipsies as to whether anything was known of Zoraya
      Prebel or her brother Sebastian; but after some delay and various
      excitements nothing was discovered, but that there had been a family, who
      were esteemed recreants to their race, and had sold their children to the
      managers of German or Italian bands of musicians. One brother had come
      back a broken man, who had learnt vices and ruined himself, though he
      talked largely of his wonderful success in company with his sister, who
      had made grand marriages. What had become of her he did not know; and when
      Gerald went with Mr. Audley to a little mountain valley to visit him, he
      had been dead for a week or more.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this had made some delay, and it was almost the end of the long
      vacation. Charles Audley undertook to go to Trieste with the travellers,
      and make inquiries about Zoraya and her first husband. Sir Robert, the
      Skipper, as the family still termed him, had written for his yacht to meet
      him there, and be ready for him to convey the party to Sicily. He
      professed that he could not lose sight of Franceska, with whom he declared
      himself nearly as much smitten as ever he had been with his
      daughter-in-law.
    </p>
    <p>
      They left that pretty creature in her happy home, and arrived at Trieste,
      where Charles Audley set various agencies to work, and arrived at a
      remembrance of Giovanni Benista, an impresario, having been in a state of
      great fury at his wife, his most able performer, having fled from him just
      as he had been at the expense of training and making her valuable. He
      tried to have her pursued, but there was reason to think that she had been
      smuggled away in an English or American ship, and nothing could be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus much of the story then was confirmed, and Gerald had little or no
      doubt of the rest of it, but he was obliged to leave the pursuit of the
      quest to his uncle and aunt, being somewhat consoled for having to return
      to England by the expectation of hearing from Mr. Maurice Mohun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twice he returned for his aunt&rsquo;s last kiss, nay, even a third time, and
      then with the half-choked words, &ldquo;My true, my dearest mother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he absolutely bent his knee as he asked for his uncle Clement&rsquo;s
      blessing.

     And deemed themselves a shameful part
     Of pageant which they cursed in heart.&mdash;SCOTT.
</pre>
    <p>
      Dolores was waiting till the Christmas term to go to her college. The fame
      of her volcanic lectures had reached Avoncester, and she was entreated to
      repeat them at the High School there. The Mouse-trap had naturally been
      sent to Miss Vincent, the former governess, who had become head-mistress
      of the High School at Silverton, and she wrote an urgent request that her
      pupils might have the advantage of the lectures. Would Dolores come and
      give her course there, and stay a few days with her, reviving old times?
    </p>
    <p>
      Dolores consented, being always glad of an opportunity of trying her
      wings, though she had not the pleasantest recollections connected with
      Silverton, but she would be really glad to see Miss Vincent, who had been
      always kind to her. So she travelled up to Silverton, and found the
      head-mistress living in cheerful rooms, with another of the teachers in
      the same house, all boarding together, but with separate sitting-rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dolores&rsquo; first walk was to see Miss Hackett. It was quite startling to
      find the good old lady looking exactly the same as when she had come to
      luncheon at Silverfold, and arranged for G. F. S., and weakly stood up for
      her sister nine years previously, those years which seemed ages long ago
      to the maiden who had made the round of the world since, while the lady
      had only lived in her Casement Cottage, and done almost the same things
      day by day.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was one exception, however, Constance had married a union doctor in
      the neighbourhood. She came into Silverton to see her old acquaintance,
      and looked older and more commonplace than Dolores could have thought
      possible, and her talk was no longer of books and romances, but of smoking
      chimneys, cross landlords, and troublesome cooks, and the wicked neglects
      of her vicar&rsquo;s and her squire&rsquo;s wife. As Dolores walked back to Silverton,
      she heard drums and trumpets, and was nearly swept away by a rushing
      stream of little boys and girls. Then came before her an elephant, with
      ornamental housing and howdah, and a train of cars, meant to be very fine,
      but way-worn and battered, with white and piebald steeds, and gaudy
      tinselly drivers, and dames in scarlet and blue, much needing a washing,
      distributing coloured sheets about the grand performance to take place
      that night at eight o&rsquo;clock, of the Sepoy&rsquo;s Death Song and the Bleeding
      Bride.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Vincent had asked Miss Hackett to supper, and prepared herself and
      her fellow-teacher, Miss Calton, for a pleasant evening of talk, but to
      her great surprise, Dolores expressed her intention of going to the
      performance at the circus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said Miss Vincent, &ldquo;this is a very low affair&mdash;not
      Sanger&rsquo;s, nor anything so respectable. They have been here before, and the
      lodging-house people went and were quite shocked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Dolores, &ldquo;but that is all the more reason I want to go. There
      is a girl with them in whom we are very much interested. She was kidnapped
      from Rockquay at the time this circus was there. At least I am almost sure
      it is the same, and I must see if she is there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if she is you cannot do anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I can; I can let her brother know. It must be done, Miss Vincent. I
      have promised, and it is of fearful consequence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Should you know her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes. I have often talked to her in Mrs. Henderson&rsquo;s class. I could not
      mistake her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Hackett was so much horrified at the notion of a G. F. S. &ldquo;business
      girl&rdquo; being in bondage to a circus, that she gallantly volunteered to go
      with Miss Mohun, and Miss Vincent could only consent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The place of the circus was an open piece of ground lying between
      Silverton and Silverfold, and thither they betook themselves&mdash;Miss
      Hackett in an old bonnet and waterproof that might have belonged to any
      woman, and Dolores wearing a certain crimson ulster, which she had bought
      in Auckland for her homeward voyage, and which her cousins had chosen to
      dub as &ldquo;the Maori.&rdquo; After a good deal of jostling and much scent of beer
      and bad tobacco they achieved an entrance, and sat upon a hard bench, half
      stifled with the odours, to which were added those of human and equine
      nature and of paraffin. As to the performance, Dolores was too much
      absorbed in looking out for Ludmilla, together with the fear that Miss
      Hackett might either faint or grow desperate, and come away, to attend
      much to it; and she only was aware that there was a general scurrying, in
      which the horses and the elephant took their part; and that men and
      scantily dressed females put themselves in unnatural positions; that there
      was a firing of pistols and singing of vulgar songs, and finally the hero
      and heroine made their bows on the elephant&rsquo;s back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Hackett wanted to depart before the Bleeding Bride came on, but
      Dolores entreated her to stay, and she heroically endured a little longer.
      This seemed, consciously or not, to be a parody of the ballad of Lord
      Thomas and Fair Annet, but of course it began with an abduction on
      horseback and a wild chase, in which even the elephant did his part, and
      plenty more firing. Then the future bride came on, supposed to be hawking,
      during which pastime she sang a song standing upright on horseback, and
      the faithless Lord Thomas appeared and courted her with the most
      remarkable antics of himself and his piebald steed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The forsaken Annet consoled herself with careering about, taking a last
      leave of her beloved steed&mdash;a mangy-looking pony&mdash;and performing
      various freaks with it, then singing a truculent song of revenge, in
      pursuance of which she hid herself to await the bridal procession. And as
      the bride came on, among her attendants Dolores detected unmistakably
      those eyes of Gerald&rsquo;s! She squeezed Miss Hackett&rsquo;s hand, and saw little
      more of the final catastrophe. Somehow the bride was stabbed, and fell
      screaming, while the fair Annet executed a war dance, but what became of
      her was uncertain. All Dolores knew was, that Ludmilla was there! She had
      recognized not only the eyes, but the air and figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they got free of the crowd, which was a great distress to poor Miss
      Hackett, Dolores said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is that poor girl! She must be saved!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How? What can you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall telegraph to her brother. You will help me, Miss Hackett?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;what&mdash;who is her brother?&rdquo; said Miss Hackett, expecting to
      hear he was a carpenter perhaps, or at least a clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Underwood of Vale Leston&mdash;Gerald Underwood,&rdquo; answered Dolores.
      &ldquo;His father made an unfortunate marriage with a singer. She really is his
      half-sister, and I promised to do all I could to help him to find her and
      save her. He is at Oxford. I shall telegraph to him the first thing
      to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing in this to object to, and Miss Hackett would not be
      persuaded not to see her to the door of Miss Vincent&rsquo;s lodgings, though
      lengthening her own walk&mdash;alone, a thing more terrible to her
      old-fashioned mind than to that of her companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dolores wrote her telegram&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dolores Mohun, Valentia, Silverton, to Gerald Underwood, Trinity College,
      Oxford. Ludmilla here. Circus. Come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sent it with the more confidence that she had received a letter from
      her father with a sort of conditional consent to her engagement to Gerald,
      so that she could, if needful, avow herself betrothed to him; though her
      usual reticence made her unwilling to put the matter forward in the
      present condition of affairs. She went out to the post-office at the first
      moment when she could hope to find the telegraph office at work, and just
      as she had turned from it, she met a girl in a dark, long, ill-fitting
      jacket and black hat, with a basket in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lydia!&rdquo; exclaimed Dolores, using the old Rockquay name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Dolores!&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes. You are here! I saw you last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me! Me! Oh, I am ashamed that you did. Don&rsquo;t tell Mr. Flight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There were tears starting to her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I do anything for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;no. Oh, if you could! But they have apprenticed me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who have?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother and Mr. O&rsquo;Leary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are they here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. They wanted money&mdash;apprenticed me to this Jellicoe! I must make
      haste. They sent me out to take something to the wash, and buy some fresh
      butter. They must not guess that I have met any one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will walk with you. I have been telegraphing to your brother that I
      have found you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he was so good to me! And Mr. Flight, I was so grieved to fail him.
      They made me get up and dress in the night, and before I knew what I was
      about I was on the quay&mdash;carried out to the ship. I had no paper&mdash;no
      means of writing; I was watched. And now it is too dreadful! Oh, Miss
      Dolores! if Mrs. Henderson could see the cruel positions they try to force
      on me, the ways they handle me&mdash;they hurt so; and what is worse, no
      modest girl could bear the way they go on, and want me to do the same. I
      could when I was little, but I am stiffer now, and oh! ashamed. If I can&rsquo;t&mdash;they
      starve me&mdash;yes, and beat me, and hurt me with their things. It is
      bondage like the Israelites, and I don&rsquo;t want to get to like it, as they
      say I shall, for then&mdash;then there are those terrible songs to be
      sung, and that shocking dress to be shown off in. My mother will not help.
      She says it is what she went through, and all have to do, and that I shall
      soon leave off minding; but oh, I often think I had rather die than grow
      like&mdash;like Miss Bellamour. I hope I shall (they often frighten me
      with that horse), only somehow I can&rsquo;t wish to be killed at the moment,
      and try to save myself. And once I thought I would let myself fall, rather
      than go on with it, but I thought it would be wicked, and I couldn&rsquo;t. But
      I have prayed to God to help me and spare me; and now He has heard. And
      will my brother be able&mdash;or will he choose to help me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure of it, my poor dear girl. He wishes nothing more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please turn this way. They must not see me speak to any one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One word more. How long is the circus to be here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We never know; it depends on the receipts&mdash;may go to-morrow. Oh,
      there&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hurried on without another word, and Dolores slowly returned to Miss
      Vincent&rsquo;s lodgings. Her lecture was to be given at three o&rsquo;clock, but she
      knew that she should have to be shown the school and class-rooms in the
      forenoon. Gerald, as she calculated the trains, might arrive either by
      half-past twelve or a quarter past four.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nervously she endured her survey of the school, replying to the comments
      as if in a dream, and hurrying it over, so as must have vexed those who
      expected her to be interested. She dashed off to the station, and reached
      it just in time to see the train come in. Was it&mdash;yes, it was Gerald
      who sprang out and came towards her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dolores! My gallant Dolores! You have found her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but in cruel slavery&mdash;apprenticed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That can be upset. Her mother&mdash;is she here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and O&rsquo;Leary. They sold her, apprenticed her, and these people use
      her brutally. She told me this morning. No, I don&rsquo;t think you can get at
      her now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will see her mother at any rate. I may be able to buy her off. Where
      shall I find you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dolores told him, but advised him to meet her at Miss Hackett&rsquo;s, whom she
      thought more able to help, and more willing than Miss Vincent, in case he
      was able to bring Ludmilla away with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you heard from my father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;what I expected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it will make no difference in the long run.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearest, do I not trust your brave words? From Trieste I hear that the
      endeavour of Benista to recover his wife is proved. There&rsquo;s one step of
      the chain. Is it dragging us down, or setting us free?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Free&mdash;free from the perplexities of property,&rdquo; cried Dolores. &ldquo;Free
      to carve out a life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly I have wished I was a younger son. Only if it could have come
      in some other way!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dolores had to go to luncheon at Miss Vincent&rsquo;s, and then to deliver her
      lecture. It was well that she had given it so often as almost to know it
      by heart, for the volcano of anxiety was surging high within her.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she went out she saw Gerald waiting for her, and his whole mien spoke
      of failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Failed! Yes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The poor child is regularly bound to that
      Jellicoe, the master of the concern, for twenty-five pounds, the fine that
      my uncle brought on the mother, as O&rsquo;Leary said with a grin, and she is
      still under sixteen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there no hope till then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He and O&rsquo;Leary declare there would be breach of contract if she left them
      even then. I don&rsquo;t know whether they are right, but any amount of mischief
      might be done before her birthday. They talk of sending her to Belgium to
      be trained, and that is fatal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t she be bought off?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I tried, but I can&rsquo;t raise more than seventy pounds at the
      utmost just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could help. I have twenty-three pounds. I could give up my term.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No use. They know that I shall not be of age till January, besides the
      other matter. I assured them that however that might end, my uncles would
      honour any order I might give for the sake of rescuing her, but they
      laughed the idea to scorn. O&rsquo;Leary had the impudence to intimate, however,
      that if I chose to accept the terms expressed, &lsquo;his wife might be
      amenable.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five hundred for evidence on the previous marriage in my favour; but I am
      past believing a word that she says, at least under O&rsquo;Leary&rsquo;s dictation.
      She might produce a forgery. So I told him that my uncle was investigating
      the matter with the consul in Sicily; and the intolerable brutes sneered
      more than over at the idea of the question being in the hands of the
      interested party, when they could upset that meddling parson in a moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can nothing be done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought of asking one of your old ladies whether there is a lawyer or
      Prevention of Cruelty man who could tell me whether the agreement holds,
      but I am afraid she is too old. You saw no mark of ill-usage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no. They would be too cunning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we could help her to escape what a lark it would be!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do believe we could&rdquo; cried Dolores. &ldquo;If I could only get a note to her!
      And this red ulster! I wonder if Miss Hackett would help!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dolores waited for Miss Hackett, who had lingered behind, and told her as
      much of the facts as was expedient. There was a spice of romance in the
      Hackett soul, and the idea of a poor girl, a G. F. S. maiden, in the hands
      of these cruel and unscrupulous people was so dreadful that she was
      actually persuaded to bethink herself of means of assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you meet the girl?&rdquo; she said. Dolores told her the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! depend upon it the things were with Mrs. Crachett, who I know has
      done washing for people about on fair-days, when they can&rsquo;t do it
      themselves. She has a daughter in my G. F. S. class; I wonder if we could
      get any help from her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a very odd device for a respectable associate and member of G. F.
      S. to undertake, but if ever the end might justify the means it was on the
      present occasion. Fortune favoured them, for Melinda Crachett was alone in
      the house, ironing out some pale pink garments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you washing for those people on the common, Melinda?&rdquo; asked Miss
      Hackett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Miss Hackett. They want them by seven o&rsquo;clock to-night very
      particular, and they promised me a seat to see the performance, miss, if I
      brought them in good time, and I wondered, miss, if you would object.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only tell me, Melinda, whom you saw.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw the lady herself, ma&rsquo;am, the old lady, when I took the things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No young person?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am. It was a very nice young lady indeed that brought me down
      this pink tunic, because it got stained last night, and she said her
      orders was to promise me a ticket if it came in time; but, oh my! ma&rsquo;am,
      she looked as if she wanted to tell me not to come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor girl! She is a G. F. S. member, Melinda, and I do believe you would
      be doing a very good deed if you could help us to get her away from those
      people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Melinda&rsquo;s eyes grew round with eagerness. She had no doubts respecting
      what Miss Hackett advised her to do, and there was nothing for it but to
      take the risk. Then and there Dolores sat down and pencilled a note,
      directing Ludmilla to put on the red ulster after her performance, if
      possible, when people were going away, and slip out among them, joining
      Melinda, who would convey her to Miss Hackett&rsquo;s. This was safer than for
      Gerald to be nearer, since he was liable to be recognized. Still it was a
      desperate risk, and Dolores had great doubts whether she should ever see
      her red Maori again.
    </p>
    <p>
      So in intense anxiety the two waited in Miss Hackett&rsquo;s parlour, where the
      good lady left them, as she said, to attend to her accounts, but really
      with an inkling or more of the state of affairs between them. Each had
      heard from New Zealand, and knew that Maurice Mohun was suspending his
      consent till he had heard farther from home, both as to Gerald&rsquo;s character
      and prospects, and there was no such absolute refusal, even in view of his
      overthrow of the young man&rsquo;s position, as to make it incumbent on them to
      break off intercourse. Colonial habits modified opinion, and to know that
      the loss was neither the youth&rsquo;s own fault nor that of his father, would
      make the acceptance a question of only prudence, provided his personal
      character were satisfactory. Thus they felt free to hold themselves
      engaged, though Gerald had further to tell that his letters from Messina
      purported that an old priest had been traced out who had married the
      impresario, Giovanni Benista, a native of Piedmont, to Zoraya Prebel,
      Hungarian, in the year 1859, when ecclesiastical marriages were still
      valid without the civil ceremony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another step in my descent,&rdquo; said Gerald. &ldquo;Still, it does not prove
      whether this first husband was alive. No; and Piedmont, though a small
      country, is a wide field in which to seek one who may have cut all
      connection with it. However, these undaunted people of mine are resolved
      to pursue their quest, and, as perhaps you have heard, are invited to stay
      at Rocca Marina for the purpose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think that was a good measure; Mr. White gets quarry-men from
      all the country round, and would be able to find out about the villages.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how unlikely it is that one of these wanderers would have kept up
      intercourse with his family! They may do their best to satisfy the general
      conscience, but I see no end to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a more immediate question&mdash;what are we to do with your sister if
      she escapes to-night? Shall I take her to Mrs. Henderson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She would not be safe there. No, I must carry her straight to America,
      the only way to choke off pursuit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You! Your term!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind that. I shall write to the Warden pleading urgent private
      business. I have enough in hand for our passage, and the &lsquo;Censor&rsquo; will
      take my articles and give me an introduction. I shall be able to keep
      myself and her. I have a real longing to see Fiddler&rsquo;s Ranch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But can you rough it?&rdquo; asked Dolores, anxiously looking at his delicate
      girlish complexion and slight figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes! I was born to it. I know what it was when Fiddler&rsquo;s Ranch was far
      from the civilization of Violinia, as they call it now. I don&rsquo;t mean to
      make a secret of it, and grieve your heart or Cherie&rsquo;s. She has had enough
      of that, but I must make the plunge to save my sister, and if things come
      round it will be all the better to have some practical knowledge of the
      masses and the social problems by living among them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh that I could make the experiment with you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be my inspiration and encouragement, and come to me in due
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He came round to her, and she let him give her his first kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God will help us,&rdquo; she said reverently; &ldquo;it is the cause of uprightness
      and deliverance from cruel bondage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The plans had been settled; Gerald had arranged with a cab which was to
      take him and his sister to a house five miles out in the country, of which
      Miss Hackett had given the name, so that they might seem to have been
      spending the evening with her. Thence it was but a step to the station of
      a different railway from that which went through Silverton, and they would
      go by the mail train to London, where Ludmilla could be deposited at Mrs.
      Grinstead&rsquo;s house at Brompton, where Martha could provide her with an
      outfit, while Gerald saw the editor of the &lsquo;Censor&rsquo;, got some money from
      the bank, telegraphed to Oxford for his baggage, and made ready to start
      the next morning for Liverpool, whither he had telegraphed to secure a
      second-class passage to New York for G. F. Wood and Lydia Wood, the names
      which he meant to be called by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first name I knew,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the name of Tom Wood, is far more real
      to me or my father than Edgar Underwood ever could be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He promised that Dolores should have a telegram at Clipstone by the time
      she reached it, for she had to give her second lecture the next day, and
      was to return afterwards. All this had been discussed over and over again,
      and there had been many quakings and declarations that the scheme had
      failed, and that neither girl could have had courage, nor perhaps
      adroitness, and that the poor prisoner had been re-captured. Gerald had
      made more than one expedition into the little garden to listen, and had
      filled the house with cold air before he returned, sat down in a resigned
      fashion, and declared&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all up! That comes of trusting to fools of girls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hark!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sprang up and out into the vestibule. Miss Hackett opened the door into
      the back passage. There stood the &ldquo;red mantle&rdquo; and Melinda Crachett.
      Gerald took the trembling figure in his arms with a brotherly kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My little sister,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;look to me,&rdquo; then gave her to Dolores, who
      led her into the drawing-room, and put her into an arm-chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could hardly stand, but tried to jump up as Miss Hackett entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, my poor child,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;sit still! Rest. Were you followed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I don&rsquo;t think they had missed me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was so breathless that Miss Hackett would have given her a glass of
      wine, but she shook her head,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no, thank you! I&rsquo;ve kept the pledge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tea-things were there, waiting for her arrival. Dolores would have
      helped her take off the red garment, but she shrank from it. She had only
      her gaudy theatrical dress beneath. How was she to go to London in it?
      However, Miss Hackett devised that she should borrow the little
      maid-servant&rsquo;s clothes, and Gerald undertook to send them back when Martha
      should have fitted her out at Brompton. The theatrical costume Miss
      Hackett would return by a messenger without implicating Melinda Crachett.
      They took the girl up-stairs to effect the change, and restore her as much
      as they could, and she came down with her rouge washed off, and very pale,
      but looking like herself, as, poor thing, she always did look more or less
      frightened, and now with tears about her eyelids, tears that broke forth
      as Gerald went up to her, took her by the hand, and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brighten up, little sister; you have given yourself to me, and I must
      take care of you now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I do beg your pardon, but my poor mother&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t know&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to go back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no, no,&rdquo; and she shuddered again; &ldquo;but I am sorry for her. She has
      such a hard master, and she used to be good to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Hackett had come opportunely to make her drink some tea, and then
      made both take food enough to sustain them through the night journey.
      Then, and afterwards, they gathered what had been Ludmilla&rsquo;s sad little
      story. Her father, in spite of his marriage, which was according to the
      lax notions of German Protestants, had been a fairly respectable man, very
      fond of his little daughter, and exceedingly careful of her, though even
      as a tiny child he had made her useful, trained her to singing and
      dancing, and brought her forward as a charming little fairy, when it was
      all play to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we were so happy in those days,&rdquo; she said tearfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he died it was with an injunction to his wife not to bring up
      Ludmilla to the stage now that he was not there to take care of her. With
      the means he had left she had set up her shop at Rockquay, and though she
      had never been an affectionate mother, Ludmilla had been fairly happy, and
      had been a favourite with Mr. Flight and the school authorities, and had
      been thoroughly imbued with their spirit. A change had, however, come over
      her mother ever since an expedition to Avoncester, when she had met
      O&rsquo;Leary. She had probably always contrived a certain amount of illicit
      trade in tobacco and spirits by means of the sailors in the foreign
      traders who put into the little harbour of Rockquay; but her daughter was
      scarcely cognizant of this, and would not have understood the evil if she
      had done so, nor did it affect her life. O&rsquo;Leary had, however, been the
      clown in Mr. Schnetterling&rsquo;s troupe, and had become partner with Jellicoe.
      The sight of him revived all Zoraya&rsquo;s Bohemian inclinations, and on his
      side he knew her to have still great capabilities, and recollected enough
      of her little daughter to be sure that she would be a valuable possession.
      Moreover, Mrs. Schnetterling had carried her contraband traffic a little
      too far, especially where the boys of the preparatory school were
      concerned. She began to fear the gauger and the policeman, and she had
      consented to marry O&rsquo;Leary at the Avoncester register office, meaning to
      keep the matter a secret until she could wind up her affairs at Rockquay.
      Even her daughter was kept in ignorance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two occurrences had, however, precipitated matters. One was the stir that
      Clement had made about the school-boys&rsquo; festival, ending in the fine being
      imposed; the other, the discovery that the graceful, well-endowed young
      esquire was the child who had been left to probable beggary with a dying
      father twenty years previously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jellicoe, the principal owner of the circus, advanced the money for the
      fine, on condition of the girl and her mother becoming attached to the
      circus; and the object of O&rsquo;Leary was to make as much profit as possible
      out of the mystery that hung over the young heir of Vale Leston. His
      refusal to attend to the claim on him, together with spite at his uncle,
      as having brought about the prosecution, and to Mr. Flight for hesitating
      to remunerate the girl for the performance that was to have been free;
      perhaps too certain debts and difficulties, all conspired to occasion the
      midnight flitting in such a manner as to prevent the circus from being
      pursued.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thenceforth poor Lida&rsquo;s life had been hopeless misery, with all her
      womanly and religious instincts outraged, and the probability of worse in
      future. Jellicoe, his wife, and O&rsquo;Leary had no pity, and her mother very
      little, and no principle; and she had no hope, except that release might
      come by some crippling accident. Workhouse or hospital would be
      deliverance, since thence she could write to Mrs. Henderson.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook and trembled still lest she should be pursued, though Miss
      Hackett assured her that this was the last place to be suspected, and it
      was not easy to make her eat. Presently Gerald stood ready to take her to
      the cab.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dolores came to the gate with them. There was only space for a fervent
      embrace and &ldquo;God bless you!&rdquo; and then she stood watching as they went away
      into the night.

      CHAPTER XXVIII. &mdash; ROCCA MARINA
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     There was of course in Adeline
       A calm patrician polish in the address,
     Which ne&rsquo;er can pass the equinoctial line
       Of anything which nature could express.&mdash;BYRON.
</pre>
    <p>
      It was a late autumn or winter day, according to the calendar, when The
      Morning Star steamed up to the quay of Rocca Marina, but it was hard to
      believe it, for all the slope of one of the Maritime Alps lay stretched
      out basking in the noonday sunshine, green and lovely, wherever not broken
      by the houses below, or the rocks quarried out on the mountain side. Some
      snow lay on the further heights, enough to mark their forms, and contrast
      with the soft sweetness of the lap of the hills and the glorious
      Mediterranean blue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anna and Franceska stood watching and exclaiming in a trance of delight,
      as one beauty after another revealed itself&mdash;the castellated remnant
      of the old tower, the gabled house with stone balconies and terraces, with
      parapets and vases below, the little white spire of the church tower of
      the English colony, looking out of the chestnut and olive groves above,
      and the three noble stone pines that sheltered the approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. White, in his launch, came out with exulting and hearty welcome to
      bring them ashore, through the crowd of feluccas, fishing-vessels, and one
      or two steamers that filled the tiny bay, and on landing, the party found
      an English wagonette drawn by four stout mules waiting to receive them&mdash;mules,
      as being better for the heights than horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anna and Franceska insisted on walking with Mr. White and Sir Robert, and
      they fairly frisked in the delicious air of sea and mountain after being
      so long cramped on board ship, stopping continually with screams of
      delight over violets or anemones, or the views that unfolded themselves as
      they went higher and higher. The path Mr. White chose was a good deal
      steeper than the winding carriage road cut out of the mountain side, and
      they arrived before the mules with Mrs. Grinstead and her brother, at the
      Italian garden, with a succession of broad terraces protected and adorned
      with open balustrades, with vases of late blooming flowers at intervals,
      and broad stone steps, guarded by carved figures, leading from one to
      another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is like Beauty&rsquo;s palace,&rdquo; sighed out in delight Francie to her sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Beauty,&rdquo; laughed Anna, as at the open window upon the highest
      verandah-shaded balcony appeared the darkly handsome Maura and Mrs. White,
      her small features as pretty as ever, but her figure a good deal more
      embonpoint than in Rockquay times.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hers was a very warm welcome to the two sisters and their friend, and to
      the others who reached the front door a few minutes later. Such an arrival
      was very pleasant to her, for it must be confessed that, save for the
      English visitors, who were always gladly received, the life at Rocca
      Marina was a dull one, in spite of its being near enough to San Remo by
      the railway for expeditions for a day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within, the dwelling was a combination of the old Italian palace with
      English comforts. Mr. White, in his joy at possessing his graceful lady
      wife, had spared no expense in making it a meet bower for her, and
      Geraldine was as much amused as fascinated by the exquisiteness of all
      around her; as she sat, in a most luxurious chair, looking out through the
      open window at the blue sea, yet with a lively wood fire burning under a
      beauteous mantelpiece; statues, pictures, all that was recherche around,
      while they drank their English tea out of almost transparently delicate
      cups, filled by Maura out of a beautifully chased service of plate on a
      marble mosaic table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now you must let me show you your rooms,&rdquo; said Mrs. White. &ldquo;I thought
      you would like to have them en suite, for I am such a poor creature that I
      cannot breakfast down-stairs, and Mr. White is obliged to be out early.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So she led the way through a marble hall, pillared in different colours,
      rich and rare, with portraits of ancient Contes and Contessas on the
      walls, up a magnificent stone stair with a carved balustrade, to a suite
      indeed, where, at the entrance, Sibby was found very happy at her welcome
      from Mrs. Mount, who was equally glad to receive a countrywoman.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a sitting-room with a balcony looking out on the bay, a study
      and bedroom beyond for Clement on one side, and on the other charmingly
      fitted rooms for Geraldine, for her nieces, and her maid; and Mrs. White
      left them, telling them the dinner hour, and begging them to call freely
      and without scruple for all and everything they could wish for. Nothing
      would be any trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have even an English doctor below there,&rdquo; she said, pointing to the
      roofs of the village. &ldquo;There are so many accidents that Mr. White thought
      it better to be provided, so we have a little hospital with a trained
      nurse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was all very good, very kind, yet the very family likeness to Lilias
      Merrifield and Jane Mohun made Geraldine think how much more simple in
      manner one of them would have been without that nouveau riche tone of
      exultation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is a whole packet of letters,&rdquo; ended Mrs. White, &ldquo;that came for you
      these last two or three days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pointed to a writing-table and went away, while the first letters so
      amazed Geraldine that she could think of nothing else, and hastened to
      summon Clement.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was from Gerald, posted by the pilot from on board the steamer, very
      short, and only saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAREST CHERIE,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you will forgive me, or rather see that I do not need pardon for
      rescuing my sister. Anywhere in England she would be in danger of being
      reclaimed to worse than death. Dolores will tell you all the situation,
      and I will send a letter as soon as we arrive at New York. No time for
      more, except that I am as much as ever
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your own, my Cherie&rsquo;s own,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;GERALD.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There followed directions how to send letters to him through the office of
      the &lsquo;Censor&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she opened, written on the same day, a letter from Dolores Mohun,
      sent in obedience to his telegram, when he found that time for details
      failed him. It began&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAR MRS. GRINSTEAD,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you will be shocked and grieved at the step that your nephew has
      taken, but when you understand the circumstances, I think you will see
      that it was unavoidable for one of so generous and self-sacrificing a
      nature. I may add, that my aunt Lily is much touched, and thoroughly
      approves, and my uncle Jasper says imprudence is better than selfishness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After this little preamble ensued a full and sensible account of
      Ludmilla&rsquo;s situation and sufferings at the circus, and the history of her
      escape, demonstrating (to the writer&rsquo;s own satisfaction) that there was no
      other means of securing the poor child.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course the blow to Geraldine was a terrible one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have lost him,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That does not follow,&rdquo; said Clement. &ldquo;It is quite plain that he does not
      mean to cut himself off from us, and America is not out of reach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is just the restless impatience that you warned him against. As if he
      could not have taken her to the Hendersons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She would not have been safe there, unless acts of cruelty could have
      been proved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or to us, out here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Cherry, imagine his sudden arrival with such an appendage! I
      really think the boy has acted for the best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Giving up Oxford too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That can be resumed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And most likely that wretched little girl will run off in a month&rsquo;s time.
      It is in the blood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, Cherry. I can&rsquo;t have you in this uncharitable mood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I mustn&rsquo;t say what I think of that Dolores abetting him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I like her letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It fell hard upon Geraldine to keep all to herself, while entertained in
      full state by her hosts. Perhaps Adeline would have liked something on a
      smaller scale, for she knew what was ostentatious; but though Mr. White
      had once lived in a corner of the castle, almost like an artisan; since he
      had married, it had become his pride to treat his guests on the grandest
      London scale, and the presence of Sir Robert Audley for one night evoked
      all his splendours. He made excuses for having no one to meet the party
      but the chaplain and his wife and the young doctor, who he patronizingly
      assured them was &ldquo;quite the gentleman,&rdquo; and Theodore White&mdash;&ldquo;Just to
      fill up a corner and amuse the young ladies.&rdquo; Theodore had been lately
      sent out, now a clerk, soon to be a partner; but he was very shy, and did
      not amuse the young ladies at all! Indeed, he was soon so smitten with
      admiration for Franceska, that he could do nothing but sit rapt, looking
      at her under his eyelids.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chaplain had received an offer of preferment in England, and was
      anxious to go home as soon as possible. Clement was now so well, that
      after assisting the next day in the week&rsquo;s duties among the people, and at
      the pretty little church that Mr. White had built, he ventured to accept
      the proposal of becoming a substitute until the decision was made or
      another chaplain found. He was very happy to be employed once more in his
      vocation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The climate suited him exactly, and the loan of the chaplain&rsquo;s house would
      relieve him and Geraldine from the rather oppressive hospitality of the
      castle. The search for Benista&rsquo;s antecedents would of course go on with
      the assistance of Mr. White and his Italian foreman, but both assured him
      that the inquiry might be protracted, as winter was likely to cut off the
      communications with many parts of the interior, and many of the men would
      be at their distant homes till the spring advanced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime, Geraldine and her nieces had a home life, reading, studying
      Italian, drawing with endless pleasure, and the young ones walking about
      the chestnut-covered slopes. She sat in the gardens or drove with Mrs.
      White in her donkey-chaise, and would have been full of enjoyment but for
      the abiding anxiety about Gerald. It was rather a relief not to be living
      in the same house with the Whites, whose hospitality and magnificence were
      rather oppressive. Mr. White wanted to have everything admired, and its
      cost appreciated; and Adeline, though clever enough, had provoking
      similarities and dissimilarities to her sisters. The same might be said of
      Maura, to whom Francie at first took a great fancy, but Anna, who had seen
      more of the world, had a sense of distrust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something fawning about her ways,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t know
      whether she is quite sincere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it is only being half Greek,&rdquo; said Geraldine.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the two families met every day, and Mrs. White called their
      intercourse &ldquo;such a boon, such a charming friendship,&rdquo; all unaware that
      there was no real confidence or affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had not long been seated when the little Italian messenger boy
      brought them a budget of letters. Of course the first that Geraldine
      opened was in her nephew&rsquo;s writing. It had been written at intervals
      throughout the voyage, and finished on landing at New York.
    </p>
    <p>
      Passing over the expressions of unabated affection, and explanation of the
      need of removing Ludmilla out of reach of her natural guardians, with the
      date on the second day of the voyage, the diary continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom, as the fates would have it, should I have encountered but the
      Cacique! Yes, old Fernan and Marilda have the stateliest of staterooms in
      this same liner, and he was as much taken aback as I was when we ran
      against one another over a destitute and disconsolate Irish family in the
      steerage. Marilda is as yet invisible, as is my poor little Lida. It is
      unlucky, for the good man is profuse in his offers of patronage, and I
      don&rsquo;t mean to be patronized.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, after some clever descriptions of the fellow second-class passengers
      in his own lively vein, perhaps a little forced, so as not to betray more
      than he intended, that he felt them uncongenial, there came&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lida is up again; she is a sweet little patient person, and I cannot
      withstand Fernan&rsquo;s wish to present her to his wife, who remains prostrate
      at present, and will till we get out of the present stiff breeze and its
      influences.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;12th.&mdash;The presentation is over, and it has ended in Lida devoting
      herself to the succour of Marilda, and likewise of her maid, who is a good
      deal worse than herself.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      &ldquo;16th.&mdash;These amiable folks want to take Lida off with them, not to
      say myself, to their &lsquo;Underwood&rsquo; in the Rockies; but I don&rsquo;t intend her to
      be semi-lady&rsquo;s-maid, semi-companion, as she is becoming, but to let her
      stand on her own legs, or mine, and put her to a good school at New York.
      I have finished an article on &lsquo;Transatlantic Travellers&rsquo; for the &lsquo;Censor&rsquo;,
      also some reviews, and another paper that may pave my way to work in New
      York or elsewhere. My craving is for the work of hard hands, but I look at
      mine, and fear I run more to the brain than the hands. My father must have
      been of finer physique than the Sioux bullet left to me; but I have no
      fears.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed,&rdquo; sighed Geraldine; &ldquo;he has not the fine athletic strength of
      his dear father, but still&mdash;still I think there is that in him which
      Edgar had not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Force of character,&rdquo; said Clement, &ldquo;even if he is wrong-headed. Here is
      Fernan&rsquo;s letter&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Imagine my amazement at finding Gerald on board with us. He tells me
      that you are aware of his escapade, so I need not explain it. He is not
      very gracious to either of us, and absolutely refuses all offers of
      assistance either for himself or his sister. However, I hope to be able to
      keep a certain watch over him without offending him, and to obviate some
      of the difficulties in his way, perhaps unknown to him. Marilda has, as
      usual, suffered greatly on the voyage, but the little Lida, as he calls
      her, has been most attentive and useful both to her and her maid, who was
      quite helpless, and much the worst of the two. My wife was much prejudiced
      against Lida at first, but has become very fond of her, and is sure that
      she is a thoroughly good girl&mdash;worth the sacrifice Gerald has made
      for her. In his independent mood, he will not hear of our offering a home
      to the poor child; but if, as I hope, your researches turn out in his
      favour, he may consent to let us find suitable education for her. At any
      rate, I promise Geraldine not to leave these two young things to their
      fate, though I may have to act secretly. I can never forget how I took him
      from his father&rsquo;s side, and the baptism almost in blood. We go to New
      Orleans first, and after the cold weather home, but letters to the Bank
      will find us.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good, dear old Fernan and Marilda!&rdquo; cried Geraldine, &ldquo;I can see their
      kindness, and how, with all their goodness, it must jar on Gerald&rsquo;s
      nerves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope he won&rsquo;t be an ass,&rdquo; returned Clement. &ldquo;Such patient goodness
      ought not to be snubbed by&mdash;&rdquo; He caught his sister&rsquo;s eye, and made
      his last words &ldquo;youthful theorists.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Henderson too forwarded a letter from Lida, being sure that it would
      be a great pleasure to Mrs. Grinstead. It went into many more particulars
      about the miseries of the circus training than had been known before, and
      the fears and hints which made it plain that it had been quite right to
      avail herself of the means of escape; after which was added&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never thought to be so happy as I am here. My brother is the noblest,
      most generous, most kind of creatures, and that he should do all this for
      me, after all the harm he has suffered from my poor mother! It quite
      overpowers me when I think of it. I see a tear has dropped, but it is such
      a happy one. Please tell Mr. Flight what peace and joy this is to me,
      after all my prayers and trying to mind what he said. There are such a
      gentleman and lady here, cousins to my brother, Sir Ferdinand and Lady
      Travis Underwood. She has been more or less ill all through the voyage,
      and her maid worse, and she has let me do what I could for her, and has
      been kindness itself. They were at the bazaar. Did you see Sir Ferdinand?
      He is the very grandest and handsomest man I ever did see, and so good to
      all the poor emigrants in the steerage. He is very kind to me; but I see
      that my brother will not have me presume. They have bidden me write to
      them in any need. I never thought there could be so many good people out
      of Rockquay. Please give my duty to Mr. Flight and Lady Flight, good Miss
      Mohun, and dear Miss Dolores. I wear her ulster, and bless the thought of
      her.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXIX. &mdash; ROWENA AND HER RIVAL
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     And yet if each the other&rsquo;s name
       In some unguarded moment heard,
     The heart that once you thought so tame
       Would flutter like a wounded bird.&mdash;ANON.
</pre>
    <p>
      Letters continued to come with fair regularity; and it was understood that
      Gerald, with Lida, had taken up his quarters in an &ldquo;inexpensive&rdquo;
       boarding-house at New York, where he had sent Lida to a highly-recommended
      day-school, and he was looking out for employment. His articles had been
      accepted, he said; but the accounts of his adventures and of his
      fellow-inmates gave the sense that there was more humour in the retrospect
      than in the society, and that they were better to write about than to live
      with. He never confessed it, but to his aunt, who understood him, it was
      plain that he found it a different thing to talk philanthropic socialism,
      or even to work among the poor, and to live in the society of the
      unrefined equals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he wrote that Lida had come one day and told him that one of the
      girls, with whom she had made friends, had a bad attack of cough and
      bronchitis, and could not fulfil an engagement that she had made to come
      and sing for a person who was giving lectures upon national music. &ldquo;&lsquo;I
      looked at some of her songs,&rsquo; little Lida said in her humble way, &lsquo;and I
      know them. Don&rsquo;t you think, brother, I might take her part?&rsquo; Well, not to
      put too fine a point upon it, it was not an unwelcome notion, for my
      articles, though accepted, don&rsquo;t bring in the speedy remuneration with
      which fiction beguiles the aspirant. Only one of them, which I send you,
      has seen the light, and the &lsquo;Censor&rsquo; is slow, though sure, so dollars for
      immediate expenses run short. I called on the fellow, Mr. Gracchus B. Van
      Tromp, to see whether he were fit company for my sister, and I found him
      much superior to his name&mdash;gentlemanlike and intelligent, not
      ill-read, and pretty safe, like most Yankees, to know how to behave to a
      young girl. When he found I could accompany my sister on piano or violin
      he was transported. Moreover, he could endure to be enlightened by a
      Britisher on such little facts as the true history of Auld Robin Gray and
      the Wacht am Rhein. The lecture was a marked success. We have another
      tonight, 16th. It has resulted in a proposal to these two interesting
      performers to accompany the great Gracchus on a tour through the leading
      &lsquo;cities,&rsquo; lecturing by turns with him and assisting. He has hitherto
      picked up as he could &lsquo;local talent,&rsquo; but is glad of less uncertain help,
      and so far as appears, he is superior to jealousy, though he sees that I&rsquo;m
      better read, &lsquo;and of the cut that takes the ladies.&rsquo; It is no harm for
      Lida; she was not learning much, and I can cultivate her better when I
      have her to myself, and get her not to regard me so much like a lion, to
      be honoured with distant respect and obedience. We shall get dollars
      enough to keep us going till my talents break upon the world, and obtain
      stunning experiences for the &lsquo;Censor&rsquo;. My father&rsquo;s dear old violin is
      coming to the front. Our first start will be at Boston; but continue to
      write to Gerald F. Wood, care of Editor of &lsquo;Cole&rsquo;s Weekly&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How like his father!&rdquo; was the natural exclamation; but the details that
      followed in another week were fairly satisfactory, and the spirit of
      independence was a sound one, which had stood harder proofs than perhaps
      his home was allowed to know, though these were early days.
    </p>
    <p>
      February was beginning to open the buds and to fill the slopes with
      delicate anemones, as well as to bring back Mr. White&rsquo;s workmen, among
      whom Clement could make inquiries. One young man knew the name of Benista
      as belonging to a family in a valley beyond his own, but it was not an
      easily accessible one, and a fresh fall of snow had choked the ravine, and
      would do so for weeks to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet all was lovely on the coast, and Mr. White having occasion to go to
      San Remo, offered to take the three girls with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young ladies always have a turn for shops,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to see the coast,&rdquo; said Franceska, with a little dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I do want some gloves&mdash;and some blue embroidery silk, thank you,
      Mr. White,&rdquo; said Anna, more courteously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I want some handkerchiefs, if Mr. White will take me too!&rdquo; returned
      Uncle Clement in the same tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know so well what you mean, dear,&rdquo; observed Maura, sotto voce to
      Francie. &ldquo;It is so trying to be supposed mere common-place, when one&rsquo;s
      thoughts are on the beautiful and romantic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was just one of the sayings that had begun to go against Francie&rsquo;s
      taste, and she answered&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. White is very good-natured.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes, but so&mdash;so&mdash;you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Francie was called, and left Mr. White&rsquo;s description to be unutterable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two elder ladies spent the day together, and Mrs. Grinstead then heard
      that Jane Mohun had written, that both Lord Ivinghoe and Lady Phyllis
      Devereux were recovering from the influenza, and that Lord Rotherwood had
      had a slight touch of the complaint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a very serious thing in our family,&rdquo; said Adeline, with all the
      satisfaction of having a family, especially with a complaint, and she
      began to enumerate the victims of the Devereux house and her own, only
      breaking off to exclaim, &ldquo;I really shall write at once to beg them all to
      come here for the rest of the winter, March winds and all. My cousin
      Rotherwood has never been here, and they might be quite quiet among
      relations. So unlike a common health resort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. White&rsquo;s hospitable anticipations were forestalled. The party came
      home from San Remo in high spirits. They had met Lord Rotherwood and his
      son in the street, they had been greeted most warmly, and brought to
      luncheon at the villa, where they found not only Lady Rotherwood and
      Phyllis, but Mysie Merrifield.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was explained that their London doctor had strongly advised immediate
      transplantation before there was time to catch fresh colds, and a friend
      of the Marchioness, who permanently possessed a charming house at San
      Remo, had offered it just as it was for the spring. The journey had been
      made at once, with one deviation on Lord Rotherwood&rsquo;s part, to beg for
      Mysie, as an essential requisite to his &ldquo;Fly&rsquo;s&rdquo; perfect recovery. A visit
      had been due before, only deferred by the general illness, and no
      difficulty was made in letting it be paid in these new and delightful
      scenes. Phyllis had been there before. She was weak and languid, and would
      much rather have stayed at home, except for seeing Mysie&rsquo;s delight in the
      mountains and the blue Mediterranean, which she dimly remembered from her
      infancy at Malta. Only she made it a point of honour not to allow that the
      sea was bluer than the bay of Rockquay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ivinghoe was looking ill and disgusted, but brightened up at the sight of
      the visitors, and his mother, who thought Monte Carlo too near, though she
      had kept as far from it as possible, accepted the more willingly Mr.
      White&rsquo;s cordial invitation to come and spend a day or two at Rocca Marina.
      Trifles were so much out of the good lady&rsquo;s focus of vision that the
      possible dangers in that quarter never occurred to her, though Maura was
      demurely bridling, and Francie, all unawakened, but prettier than ever,
      was actually wearing a scarlet anemone that Ivinghoe had given to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the intervening days, Rocca Marina was in a wonderful state of
      preparation. The master of it was genuinely and honestly kindly and
      simple-hearted, and had entertained noble travellers before, who had been
      attracted by his extensive and artistic works; but no words can describe
      the satisfaction of his wife. In part there was the heartfelt pleasure of
      receiving the cousin who had been like one of her brothers in the home of
      her childhood; but to this was added the glory of knowing that this same
      cousin was a marquis, and that the society of San Remo, nay of all the
      Riviera and the Italian papers to boot, would know that she was a good
      deal more than the quarry-owner&rsquo;s wife. Moreover, like all her family,
      there was a sense of Lady Rotherwood&rsquo;s coming from a different sphere, and
      treating them with condescension. Jane and Lily might laugh, but to
      Adeline it was matter of a sort of aggressive awe, half as asserting
      herself as &ldquo;Victoria&rsquo;s&rdquo; equal and relation, half as protecting her from
      inferior people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Geraldine perceived and was secretly amused. Of course all the party dined
      at the castle on Saturday night, and heard some lamentations that there
      was no one else to meet the distinguished guests, for the young doctor was
      not thought worthy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I knew you would like a family party best, and the Underwoods are&mdash;almost
      connections, though&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In that &ldquo;though&rdquo; was conveyed their vast inferiority to the house of
      Mohun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always understood that it was a very good old family,&rdquo; said Lady
      Rotherwood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clement Underwood is one of the most valuable clergy in London,&rdquo; said her
      lord; &ldquo;I am glad he is recovering. I shall be delighted to hear him
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maura was standing under the pergola with Lord Ivinghoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is not it sad for poor Franceska Vanderkist?&mdash;Oh! you know about
      poor Mr. Gerald Underwood?&rdquo; said Maura, blushing a little at the awkward
      subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Ivinghoe impatiently. &ldquo;He is in America, is he not? But
      what has she to do with it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you know, after being his Mona, and all. It can&rsquo;t go any further till
      it is cleared up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phyllis and Mysie came up, asking Maura to tell them the name of a
      mountain peak with a white cap. The party came up to dinner, which was as
      genial and easy as the host and Lord Rotherwood could make it, and as
      stiff and grand as the hostess could accomplish, aided by the deftness and
      grace of her Italian servants. In the evening Theodore came up to assist
      in the singing of glees, and Clement&rsquo;s voice was a delightful and welcome
      sound in his sister&rsquo;s ears. Ivinghoe stood among the circle at the piano,
      and enjoyed. He and his sister were not particularly musical, but enough
      to enjoy those remarkable Underwood voices. After that Maura never
      promoted musical evenings.
    </p>
    <p>
      An odd little Sunday-school for the children of the English workmen had
      been instituted at Rocca Marina, where Maura had always assisted the
      chaplain&rsquo;s wife, and Anna and Francie shared the work. Mysie heard of it
      with enthusiasm, for, as Ivinghoe told her, she was pining for a breath of
      the atmosphere, but she came down to enjoy the delights thereof alone,
      taking Maura&rsquo;s small class. Maura was supposed to be doing the polite to
      Lady Phyllis, but in point of fact Phyllis was lying down in the balcony
      of her mother&rsquo;s dressing-room, and Maura was gracefully fanning herself
      under a great cork tree, while Lord Ivinghoe was lying on the grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Francie looked languid, and said it was getting dreadfully hot, but Mrs.
      Grinstead took no notice, trusting that the cessation of attentions would
      hinder any feeling from going deeper, so that&mdash;as she could not help
      saying to herself&mdash;she might not have brought the poor child out of
      the frying-pan into the fire&mdash;not an elegant proverb, but expressing
      her feeling!
    </p>
    <p>
      More especially did it do so, when she found that Lord Rotherwood was so
      much delighted with the beauty and variety of the marbles of Rocca Marina
      as to order a font to be made of them for the church that was being
      restored at Clarebridge, and he, and still more his son, found constant
      diversion in running over by train from San Remo to superintend the
      design, and to select the different colours and patterns of the stones as
      they were quarried out and bits polished so as to show their beauty. Their
      ladies often accompanied them, and these expeditions generally involved
      luncheon at the castle, and often tea at the parsonage, but it might be
      gradually observed, as time went on, that there was a shade of annoyance
      on the part of the great house at the preference sometimes unconsciously
      shown for the society of the smaller one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mysie openly claimed Anna as her own friend of some standing, and both she
      and Phyllis had books to discuss, botanical or geological discoveries to
      communicate or puzzle out, with Mrs. Grinstead or her nieces. Lord
      Rotherwood had many more interests in common with Clement Underwood than
      with Mr. White, and even the Marchioness, though more impartial and on her
      guard, was sensible to Mrs. Grinstead&rsquo;s charm of manner and depth of
      comprehension. She patronized Adeline, but respected Mrs. Grinstead as
      incapable of and insensible to patronage.
    </p>
    <p>
      That her gentlemen should have found such safe and absorbing occupation in
      the opposite direction to Monte Carlo was an abiding satisfaction to her,
      and she did not analyze the charms of the place as regarded her son. She
      had seen him amused by other young ladies, as he certainly was now by that
      Miss White, who was very handsome and very obliging.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew and he knew all the antecedents too well for alarm, till one day
      she saw Maura&rsquo;s face, as she made him pull down a spray of banksia from
      the side of a stone wall, and watched the air of gallant courtesy with
      which he presented it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Francie watched it too, as she had watched the like before, and said
      nothing, but there was an odd, dull sense of disappointment, and the glory
      had faded away from sea and sky, spring though it was. Yet there were
      pressures of the hand in greeting and parting, and kind, wistful looks, as
      if of sympathy, little services and little attentions, that set her
      foolish little heart bounding, in a way she was much ashamed to feel, and
      would have been more utterly ashamed to speak of, or to suppose observed.
      She only avowed to Anna that it was very warm, weary weather, and that she
      was tired of absence, and felt homesick, but Aunt Cherry was so kind that
      she must not be told.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Rotherwood proposed moving away, but her husband and son would not
      hear of it till their font was finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not unwelcome to any one of the elder ladies that the young
      officer&rsquo;s leave would be over in another week. Geraldine was glad that
      Francie should be freed from the trial of seeing attention absorbed by
      Maura, and herself so often left in the lurch, so far as that young lady
      could contrive it, for though not a word was said, the brightened eye and
      glowing cheek, whenever Lord Ivinghoe brought her forward, or paid her any
      deference or civility, were dangerous symptoms. Peace of mind in so modest
      and innocent a maiden would probably come back when the excitement was
      once over.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to Adeline, there was nothing she dreaded so much as the commotion that
      would be excited if Ivinghoe&rsquo;s flirtation came to any crisis. His mother
      would never forgive her, his father would hardly do so; she would feel
      like a traitor to the whole family, and all her attempts to put a check on
      endeavours on Maura&rsquo;s part to draw him on&mdash;an endeavour that began to
      be visible to her&mdash;were met by apparent unconsciousness or by tears.
      And when she ventured a word to her husband, he gruffly answered that his
      niece&rsquo;s father had been an officer in the army, and he could make it worth
      any one&rsquo;s while to take her! Young lords were glad enough in these days to
      have something to put into their pockets.

      CHAPTER XXX. &mdash; DREAMS AND NIGHTINGALES
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Then in that time and place I spoke to her.&mdash;TENNYSON.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Office of &lsquo;Lacustrian Intelligencer,&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jonesville, Ohio,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;March 20.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAREST CHERIE,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you in my last that the chief boss in the office at New York had
      written to me that he had been asked to send an intelligent young man to
      sub-edit the Lacustrian Intelligencer at Jonesville, a rising city on Lake
      Erie. I thought it would be worth while to look at it, especially as we
      were booked to give a lecture at Sandusky, and moreover our relations to
      Gracchus have been growing rather strained, and I do not think this
      wandering life good for Lida in the long run; nor are my articles paid
      enough for to be a dependence. So after holding forth at Sandusky, we took
      our passage in a little steamer which crosses the little bay in the Lake
      to Jonesville&mdash;one of those steamers just like a Noah&rsquo;s Ark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Presently Lida came up and touched me, saying in her little awestruck
      whisper (which has never been conquered), &lsquo;Brother, I am sure I saw one of
      mother&rsquo;s cigarettes.&rsquo; I said &lsquo;Bosh!&rsquo; thinking it an utter delusion; but
      she was so decided and so frightened, that I told her to go into the
      saloon, and went forward. A woman was going about the deck, offering the
      passengers a basket of candies, lights, cigarettes, and cigars. Saving for
      Lida&rsquo;s words, I never should have recognized her; she was thin to the last
      degree, haggard, yellow, excessively shabby and forlorn-looking, and with
      a hollow cough; but as her eyes met mine (those eyes that you say are our
      water-mark) both of us made a sort of leap as if to go overboard, and I
      went up to her at once, and would have spoken, but she cried out, &lsquo;What
      have you done with Lida?&rsquo; I answered that she was safe, and demanded in my
      turn where were O&rsquo;Leary and Jellicoe. &lsquo;Drowned, drowned,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;in
      the wreck of the Sirius. They&rsquo;ll never trouble you more. But Lida!&rsquo; I
      thought that it was safe to take her into the saloon to see Lida, when
      they fell into each other&rsquo;s arms, and afforded the spectators a romantic
      spectacle. Don&rsquo;t think I am making a joke of it, for it was tragic enough
      in the result of the agitation. Blood was choking the poor woman. We could
      only lay her down on the couch, and happily there were lemons on board.
      There was a good-natured Irishman who gave me all the help he could, even
      to the carrying her to his house, where his wife was equally kind. He
      fetched the priest, a French Canadian, and the doctor, and Lida has been
      watching over her most tenderly; poor things&mdash;they seem really to
      have cared for one another, and Lida will be the happier for having done
      these last duties.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;21st. She is a little better. So far as we have gathered from one who
      must not talk nor be agitated, the circus had got into difficulties and
      debt to Bast, the van proprietor. I believe Lida&rsquo;s voice was their last
      hope, and they had some ghastly scheme of disposing of her in Belgium.
      When they lost her, their chances were over, and with the proceeds of
      their last exhibition, Jellicoe and the O&rsquo;Leary pair left the elephant,
      etc., to take care of themselves and make their excuses to Mr. Bast, and
      started for Liverpool and the U. S. in the Sirius. Storms overtook them,
      the women were put into the first boat, those which followed were swamped.
      Poor fellows, I own I can&rsquo;t sing a pious dirge for them. There were three
      days of hunger and exposure before the boat was picked up, and she was
      finally landed at Quebec, where she was laid up with pleurisy in the
      hospital. And there was a subscription for the wrecked when she came out,
      which enabled her to set up this reminiscence of her old trade, drifting
      from one pier or boat to another till she came to this one, but all the
      time with this awful cough. The doctor thinks it her knell; her lungs are
      far gone, but she may probably rally in some degree for the summer, though
      hardly so as to be moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That being the case, I have been to the Lacustrian office, and engaged
      myself to be its hack, since I must have some fixed pay while she lives.
      Perhaps I shall be able to do a little extra writing and lecturing,
      especially if she gets better, enough to spare Lida to help me. Her voice
      really is a lovely soprano, and draws wonderfully, but I don&rsquo;t want it to
      be strained too early. Our good Irishwoman, Mrs. Macbride, is willing to
      let us have her two rooms, left empty by her sons going west, and her
      daughter marrying, on fair terms, Lida promising to be a sort of help and
      to teach the children. We shall eat with them. I shall be at the office
      all day and half the night, so I don&rsquo;t need a sitting-room. Don&rsquo;t be
      anxious, dear old Cherie. We shall do very well, and it is only for a
      time. Lida is like a little angel, and as thankful for a smile from her
      mother as if she had been the reprobate runaway.

    <p>
      &ldquo;Your ever-loving
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;GERALD.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was the letter that came to Mrs. Grinstead, and one with similar
      information went to Dolores Mohun at her college at Cambridge. Dolores,
      who had found Mysie much more sympathetic than Gillian, could not but
      write the intelligence to her, and Mysie was so much struck with the
      beauty of the much-injured brother and sister devoting themselves to their
      mother, that she could not help telling the family party at breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said Lord Rotherwood. &ldquo;The mother can clear up the doubt
      if any one can. Is there nothing about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Mysie; &ldquo;I should think the poor woman was too ill to be
      asked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They must not let her slip through their fingers without telling,&rdquo; added
      Ivinghoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a mind to run over to Rocca Marina and see what more they have
      heard there,&rdquo; said Lord Rotherwood. &ldquo;I suppose your letter is from one of
      the girls there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no, it is from Dolores.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dolores! She is at Cambridge. Then this news must have been round by
      Clipstone! They must have known it for days past at Rocca!&rdquo; exclaimed Lord
      Rotherwood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mysie, &ldquo;this came direct to Dolores from Gerald Underwood
      himself.&mdash;Oh, didn&rsquo;t you know? I forgot, nobody was to know till
      Uncle Maurice gave his consent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Consent to what?&rdquo; exclaimed Ivinghoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Dolores and Gerald! Oh dear, mamma said so much to me about not
      telling, but I did think Cousin Rotherwood knew everything. Please&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whatever she was going to ask was cut short by Ivinghoe&rsquo;s suddenly
      striking on the table so as to make all the cups and saucers ring as he
      exclaimed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If ever there lived a treacherous Greek minx!&rdquo; Then, &ldquo;I beg your pardon,
      mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was off: they saw him dash out of the house. There was a train due
      nearly at this time, as all recollected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa, had not you better go with him?&rdquo; said Lady Rotherwood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will get on much better by himself, my dear,&rdquo; and Lord Rotherwood
      threw himself back in his chair and laughed heartily and merrily, to the
      amazement and mystification of the two girls. &ldquo;You will have a beauty on
      your hands, my lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, as long as it is not that horrid White girl&mdash;&rdquo; said her
      ladyship, breaking off there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very sorry Rebecca,&rdquo; said her lord, laughing the more.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Marchioness rose up, and the two cousins had to accept the signal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The train, after the leisurely fashion of continental railways, kept
      Ivinghoe fuming at the station, and rattled along so as to give travellers
      a full view of the coast, more delightful to them than to the youth, who
      had rushed off with intentions, he scarce knew what, of setting right the
      consequences of Maura&rsquo;s&mdash;was it deception, or only a thought, of
      which the wish was father?
    </p>
    <p>
      He reached the station that led to the works at Rocca Marina. The sun was
      high, the heat of the day coming on, and as he strode along, the workmen
      were leaving off to take their siesta at noontide. On he went, across the
      private walks in the terraced garden, not up the broad stone steps that
      led to the house, but to a little group of olive trees which cut off the
      chaplain&rsquo;s house from the castle gardens, and where stood a great cork
      tree, to whose branches a hammock had been fastened, and seats placed
      under it. As he opened the gate a little dog&rsquo;s bark was heard, and he was
      aware of a broad hat under the tree. Simultaneously a small Maltese dog
      sprang forward, and Francie&rsquo;s head rose from leaning over the little table
      with a start, her cheeks deeper rose than usual, having evidently gone to
      sleep over the thin book and big dictionary that lay before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it is you. Was I dreaming?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid I startled you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;only&rdquo;&mdash;she still seemed only half awake&mdash;&ldquo;it seemed to
      come out of my dream.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you were dreaming of me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no. At, least I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she said, the colour flushing into her
      face, as she sat upright, now quite awake and alive to the question,
      between truthfulness and maidenly modesty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were&mdash;you were; you don&rsquo;t deny it!&rdquo; And as she hung her head and
      grew more distressfully redder and redder, &ldquo;You know what that means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed&mdash;indeed&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t help&mdash;I never meant! Oh&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was an exclamation indeed, for Uncle Clement&rsquo;s head appeared above the
      hammock, where he too had been dozing over his book, with the words&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Halloo, young people, I&rsquo;m here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Franceska would have fled, but Ivinghoe held her hand so tight that she
      could not wrench it away. He held it, while Clement struggled to the
      ground, and then said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, there is no reason you or all the world should not know how I love
      this dearest, loveliest one. I came here this morning hoping that she may
      grant me leave to try to win her to be my own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at Francie. Her head drooped, but she had not taken her hand
      away, and the look on her face was not all embarrassment, but there was a
      rosy sunrise dawning on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      All Clement could say was something of &ldquo;Your father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He knows, he understands; I saw it in his eyes,&rdquo; said Ivinghoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Clement the surprise was far greater than it would have been to his
      sister, and the experience was almost new to him, but he could read
      Francie&rsquo;s face well enough to say&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, I think we had better let you run in and compose yourself, or go
      to your aunt, while I talk to Lord Ivinghoe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Trembling, frightened, Francie was really glad to be released, as her
      lover with one pressure said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall see you again, sweetest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She darted away, and Clement signed to Ivinghoe to sit down with him on
      the bench under the tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like this better if you had brought your father&rsquo;s full assent,&rdquo;
       he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was no time. I only read his face; he will come to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, to catch the train. I hurried away the moment I learnt that&mdash;that
      her affections were not otherwise engaged. I never saw any one like her.
      She has haunted me ever since those days at Rockquay; but&mdash;but I was
      told that she cared for your nephew, and I could not take advantage of him
      in his absence. And now I have but three days more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whoever told you was under a great error,&rdquo; said Clement gravely, &ldquo;and you
      have shown very generous self-command; but the advantages of this affair
      are so much the greatest on one side, that you cannot wonder if there is
      hesitation on our part, till we explicitly know that our poor little girl
      would not be unwelcome to your parents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that no one can compare with her for&mdash;for everything and
      anything,&rdquo; stammered Ivinghoe, breaking from his mother&rsquo;s language into
      his father&rsquo;s, &ldquo;and my father admires her as much as I do&mdash;almost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what will he and your mother say to her being absolutely penniless?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pish!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And worse&mdash;child to a spendthrift, a man of no connection, except on
      his mother&rsquo;s side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is your niece, your family have bred her up, made her so much more
      than exquisitely lovely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is a good little girl,&rdquo; said Clement, &ldquo;but what are we? No, Ivinghoe,
      I do not blame you for speaking out, and she will be the happier for the
      knowledge of your affection, but it will not be right of us to give free
      consent, without being fully assured of that of Lord and Lady Rotherwood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ivinghoe could only protest, but Clement rose to walk to the house, where
      his sister was sitting under the pergola in the agitation of answering
      Gerald&rsquo;s letter, and had only seen Francie flit by, calling to her sister
      in a voice that now struck her as having been strange and suppressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clement trusted a good deal to his sister&rsquo;s quicker perceptions and habit
      of observation to guide his opinion in the affair that had burst on him,
      and was relieved that when Ivinghoe, like the well-bred young man that he
      was, went up to her, and taking her hand said, &ldquo;I have been venturing to
      put my fate into the hands of your niece,&rdquo; she did not seem astonished or
      overwhelmed, but said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is a dear good girl; I do hope it will be for her happiness&mdash;for
      both.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said fervently. &ldquo;It will be the most earnest desire of my
      life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Geraldine thought it best to go in quest of Francie, whom she found with
      Anna, incoherent and happy in the glory of the certainty that she was
      loved, after the long trial of suppressed, unacknowledged suspense. No
      fears of parents, no thought of inequalities had occurred to trouble her&mdash;everything
      was absorbed in the one thought&mdash;&ldquo;he really did love her.&rdquo; How should
      she thank God enough, or pray enough to be worthy of such joy? There was
      no room for vexation or wonder at the delay, nor the attentions paid to
      Maura. She hushed Anna, who was inclined to be indignant, and who was
      obliged afterwards to pour out to her aunt all her wonder, though she
      allowed that on his side there was nothing to be really called flirtation,
      it was all Maura&mdash;&ldquo;she was sure Maura was at the bottom of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, don&rsquo;t let us be uncharitable; there is no need to think about
      it. Let us try to be like Francie, and swallow all up in gladness. Your
      mother&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t think what she will do for joy. It will almost make her well
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But remember, we don&rsquo;t know what his parents will say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with that sobering thought they had to go down to luncheon, where
      Francie sat blushing and entranced, too happy to speak, and Ivinghoe
      apparently contented to look at her. Afterwards he was allowed to take
      possession of her for the afternoon, so as to be able to tease her about
      what she was dreaming about him. After all it had probably been evoked by
      the dog&rsquo;s bark and his step; for she had thought a wolf was pursuing her,
      and that he had come to save her. It was quite enough to be food for a
      lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clement would have wished to keep all to themselves, at least till the
      paternal visit was over, but Ivinghoe&rsquo;s days were few, and he made sure of
      bringing his parents on the morrow. An expedition had been arranged to the
      valley where some of the Benista family were reported to live, since the
      snows had departed enough for safety; but this must needs be deferred, and
      there was no doubt that the &ldquo;reason why&rdquo; would be sought out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, so close was the great house, and so minute a watch was kept, that
      the fact of Lord Ivinghoe&rsquo;s spending the whole day at the parsonage was
      known, and conclusions were arrived at. Maura stole down in the late
      evening among the olive trees, ostensibly to ask Anna and Francie to come
      and listen to the nightingales.
    </p>
    <p>
      But thereby she was witness to a scene that showed that there was another
      nightingale for Franceska than the one who was singing with such energy
      among the olive boughs. In fact, she saw the evening farewell, and had not
      the discretion, like Anna, to withdraw herself and her eyes, but beheld,
      what had ever been sacred to both those young things, the first kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Maura, she had none of the reticent pride and shame of an English
      gentlewoman. She believed herself cruelly treated, and rushing away, fell
      on Anna, who was hovering near, watching to prevent any arrival such as
      was always probable.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would not be well to relate the angry, foolish words that Anna had to
      hear, nor how Maura betrayed herself and her own manoeuvre. It is enough
      to say that she went home, weeping demonstratively, perhaps
      uncontrollably; and that Anna, after her trying scene, was able to exalt
      more than ever Ivinghoe&rsquo;s generosity towards the absent Gerald, and
      forbearance towards Franceska. If he had ever passed the line, it was more
      Maura&rsquo;s doing than his own.

      CHAPTER XXXI. &mdash; THE COLD SHOULDER
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Loath to depose the child, your brother&rsquo;s son.&mdash;SHAKESPEARE.
</pre>
    <p>
      A telegram early the next day announced that the Rotherwood family were on
      their way, and they came in due time, the kind embrace that Francie
      received from each in turn being such as to set doubts at rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, the dread, first of Monte Carlo, and secondly of Maura White, had
      done much to prepare the way with Lady Rotherwood. If she had first heard
      of her son&rsquo;s attachment to the pretty child who acted Mona, daughter to
      the upstart Vanderkists, and with a ruined father of no good repute, she
      would have held it a foolish delusion to be crushed without delay; but
      when this same attachment had lasted eight or nine months, and had only
      found avowal on the removal of a supposed rival; when, moreover, her
      darling had been ill, had revived at the aspect of the young lady, and had
      conducted himself in a place of temptation so as to calm an anxious
      mother&rsquo;s heart, she could see with his eyes, not only that Franceska was
      really beautiful, graceful, and a true lady, but likely to develop still
      more under favourable circumstances; that she had improved in looks, air,
      and manner on her travels, also that she had never been injured by any
      contact with undesirable persons, but had been trained by the excellent
      Underwoods, whose gentle blood and breeding were undeniable. Nor would
      &ldquo;the daughter of the late Sir Adrian Vanderkist, Baronet, of Ironbeam
      Park,&rdquo; sound much amiss. He was so late, that his racing doings might be
      forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, as the Marchioness looked up to the castle, she felt that she
      could forgive a good deal to the damsel who had saved the family from the
      &ldquo;sorry Rebecca,&rdquo; who had cried all night, and was still crying, whenever
      any more tears would come, and not getting much pity from any of her
      relatives. Mr. White told her that she was a little fool to have expected
      anything from a young swell; her brother said she might have known that it
      was absurd to expect that any one could look at her when Miss Franceska
      was by; and Mrs. White observed that it was wonderful to her to see so
      little respect shown for maiden dignity, as to endure to manifest
      disappointment. Adeline might speak from ample experience, and certainly
      her words had a salutary effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the Whites en famille were not quite the same externally. When
      Lord Rotherwood, after luncheon, went to see old White at the works, and
      look after his font, he met with a reception as stiff and cold as could
      well be paid to a distinguished customer who was not at all in fault; and
      for the first time Mr. White was too busy to walk back with him to the
      castle to see Adeline, whom he found, as usual, on a couch on the terrace
      in the shade of the house, a pretty picture among the flowers and vines.
      She was much more open with him, as became one who understood more of his
      point of view.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Rotherwood, I suppose I am to congratulate you, though it is
      scarcely a fair match in a worldly point of view.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For which I care not a rap. She is a good, simple girl, and a perfect
      lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Victoria? May I ask, does not she think it a misalliance, considering
      what these Vanderkists are&mdash;and the Underwoods?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no one I respect more than Lancelot Underwood. As to Victoria,
      she is thankful that it is no worse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I know what you mean, but you can&rsquo;t wonder that my husband should
      feel it hard that there should have been some kind of flirtation. He is
      fond of Maura, you know, and he does feel that there must have been some
      slyness in some one to cause this affair to have been so suddenly sprung
      on us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Slyness&mdash;aye, I believe there was. Tell me, Ada, had you any notion
      that that lad, Gerald Underwood, was engaged to Dolores Mohun?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; who told you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mysie let it out. She had been warned not to mention it till his position
      was ascertained, Maurice&rsquo;s consent and all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must say Mysie should have spoken. It was not fair towards me to keep
      it back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still less fair of Maura, if that&rsquo;s her name, to hint at attachment
      between Franceska and the boy. That was the embargo upon my poor fellow.
      He rushed off to have it out the moment he saw how matters stood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it was a great shame; but girls are girls, especially with those
      antecedents, and Maura did not know to the contrary. You will believe me,
      Rotherwood, I never had any desire that she should succeed. I would have
      sent her away if I could; but you can&rsquo;t wonder that Mr. White is vexed,
      and feels as if there had been underhand dealing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see he is. But you will not let him make it unpleasant for the
      Underwoods.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no, no! They have not much longer to stay. They are in correspondence
      about a rheumatic clergyman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. White, however, determined not to expose Maura to her husband, though
      she reproached her, and was rather shocked by the young lady&rsquo;s
      self-defence. It was a natural idea, and no one had ever told her to the
      contrary. It was all spite in Mysie Merrifield to proclaim it after having
      kept it back so long.
    </p>
    <p>
      She really was in such a state of mind that Mrs. White was rather relieved
      that the Rotherwoods had taken Franceska to San Remo to stay till Ivinghoe
      had to depart. Anna was left to send off the little felicitous note that
      she had written to her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each and all were writing letters that would be received with rapture
      almost incredulous, for no one but Sophia could have had any preparation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is pleasant to think of poor Alda&rsquo;s delight,&rdquo; said Geraldine, over her
      writing-case. &ldquo;After all her troubles, to have her utmost ambition
      fulfilled at last; and yet&mdash;and yet it does seem turning that pretty
      creature over to a life of temptation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In good hands,&rdquo; said Clement. &ldquo;The youth himself is a nice honest fellow,
      a mere boy as yet; but it is something to have no harm in him at
      two-and-twenty and in the Guards; and his parents are evidently ready to
      watch over and guide them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If her head does not get turned,&rdquo; sighed Geraldine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as likely in any other station,&rdquo; replied Clement. &ldquo;The protection
      must come from within, not from the externals; and I do think that she&mdash;yes,
      and he too&mdash;have that Guard within them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think the sooner we are away from this place the better,&rdquo; said
      Geraldine. &ldquo;There are such things as cold shoulders, and perhaps
      displeasure is in human nature, though it is not our fault.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which is the worse for us,&rdquo; laughed her brother, &ldquo;since we can&rsquo;t beg
      pardon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cold shoulder was manifested by a note of apology the next morning
      from Mr. White. He was too busy to go with Mr. Underwood to Santa Carmela
      on this day, but had sent the young quarry-man to act as guide, and his
      foreman as interpreter. So Clement had his long ride on mule-back mostly
      in silence, though this he scarcely lamented, for he could better enjoy
      the mountain peaks and the valleys bright with rich grass, with anemones
      of all colours, hyacinths, strange primulas and gentians, without having
      to make talk to Mr. White. But his journey was without result. He did find
      an exceedingly old woman keeping sheep and spinning wool with a distaff,
      who owned to the name of Cecca Benista. She once had a brother. Yes, Gian
      was his name, but he went away, as they all did. He had a voice
      bellissima, si bellissima; and some one told her long, long ago, that he
      had made his fortune, and formed a company, but he had never come home&mdash;no,
      no, and was probably dead, though she had never heard; and he had sent
      nothing&mdash;no, no!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Clement tried the priest of the curious little church on the
      hill-side, a memory of Elijah and the convents on Mount Carmel. The
      Parrocco was a courteous man, quite a peasant, and too young to know much
      about the past generation. He gave Clement a refection of white bread,
      goats&rsquo; milk cheese, and coffee, and held up his hands on the declining of
      his thin wine. There was a kind of register of baptisms, and Giovanni
      Batista Benista was hunted out, and it was found that if alive he would be
      over seventy years old. But no more was known, and there was no proof that
      he was dead twenty-two years before!
    </p>
    <p>
      That long day had convinced Geraldine that the pleasantness of intercourse
      with the Whites was over, and she was not sorry that a letter was waiting
      for Clement to say that the rheumatic clergyman would arrive, if desired,
      in another week. This was gladly accepted, and the question remained,
      whither should they go? Clement&rsquo;s year of absence would be over in June,
      and he was anxious to get home; besides that, it was desirable to take
      Francie to her mother as soon as possible. The only cause for delay was
      the possibility of Gerald&rsquo;s extracting something further from his mother,
      which might lead to further researches on the Continent; but as most
      places were readily accessible from London, this was decided against, and
      it was determined to go back to Brompton at the same time as the
      Rotherwoods returned from San Remo.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the last Sunday Mr. White showed himself much more cordial than he had
      been since the crisis. He waited in the porch to say&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, you have given us some very excellent sermons, and I am sure
      we are much obliged to you. If I can help you any more in investigating
      that unlucky affair of your nephew, do not hesitate to write to me. I
      shall be delighted to assist you in coming to your rights.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you; though I sincerely hope they are not my rights.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, well. You are not so advanced in life but that if you came into
      anything good, you might marry and start on a new lease! You are pounds
      better than when you came here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Which last clause was so true that Clement could only own it, with thanks
      to his good-humoured host, who lingered a little still to say&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry any vexation arose about those foolish young people, but you
      see young women will wish to do the best they can for themselves, and will
      make mischief too if one listens to them. A sensible man won&rsquo;t. That&rsquo;s
      what I say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clement quite agreed, though he was not sensible of having listened to any
      of the mischief-making, but he heartily shook hands with Mr. White, and
      went away, glad to be at peace.

      CHAPTER XXXII. &mdash; THE TEST OF DAY-DREAMS
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Faith&rsquo;s meanest deed more favour bears,
       Where hearts and wills are weighed,
     Than brightest transports, choicest prayers,
       That bloom their hour and fade.&mdash;J. H. NEWMAN.
</pre>
    <p>
      That return to Brompton was the signal for the numerous worries awaiting
      Clement. First, the doctors thought him much improved, but declared that a
      return to full work at St. Matthew&rsquo;s would overthrow all the benefit of
      his long rest, and would not hear of his going back, even with another
      curate, for an experiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then all went down to Vale Leston together. Mr. Ed&rsquo;dard was welcomed with
      rapture by his old flock. Alda had been almost ill with excitement and
      delight, and had not words enough to show her ecstasy over her beautiful
      daughter, nor her gratitude to Geraldine, to whose management she insisted
      on attributing the glorious result. In vain did Geraldine disclaim all
      diplomacy, Lady Vanderkist was sure that all came of her savoir faire. At
      any rate, it was really comfortable to be better beloved by Alda than ever
      in the course of her life! Alda even intimated that she should be well
      enough to come to Brompton to assist in the choice of the trousseau, and
      the first annoyance was with Clement for not allotting a disproportioned
      sum for the purpose. He declared that Francie ought not to have more spent
      on her than was reserved for her sisters, especially as it would be easy
      for her to supply all deficiencies, while Alda could not endure that the
      future Lady Ivinghoe should have an outfit unworthy of her rank, even
      though both Wilmet and Geraldine undertook to assist.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were other difficulties, for which the sojourn at Vale Leston was to
      be dreaded. Gerald had been of age for two months, and there were leases
      to be signed and arrangements made most difficult to determine in the
      present state of things. Major and Mrs. Harewood wanted to wind up their
      residence in the Priory, and to be able to move as soon as the wedding was
      over, since Franceska begged that it might be at the only home she
      remembered, and her elders put aside their painful recollections to
      gratify her; so that it was fixed for early August, just a year since her
      unprepared appearance as Mona.
    </p>
    <p>
      After all, Alda was really too ill to go to London, and Franceska had to
      be sent in charge of her aunt Cherry and of her sister Mary. Lady
      Rotherwood would be in town, and might be trusted to have no unreasonable
      expectations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Sophy! Penbeacon&rsquo;s destiny was one of the affairs that could not be
      settled, and therewith her own, though her mother could not succeed in
      penetrating any of the family with the horror of giving Lord Ivinghoe such
      a brother-in-law.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of the preparations came a letter from Gerald. He did indeed
      write every Sunday, but of late his had been hurried letters: he was so
      fully occupied and had so much writing on hand that he could not indulge
      in more length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been urging me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to find out what my mother knows. I
      have not liked to press the subject while she was so ill, as she always
      met every hint of it with tears and agitation. However, at last, Lida
      brought her to it, and we really believe she knows no more than we do what
      became of her first husband. She never heard of him after she fled from
      him. She was almost a child, and he had been very cruel to her. But she
      did tell us where we may be nearly certain of finding out, namely from
      Signor Menotti, Via San Giacomo, Genoa, or his successors, a man who
      trained singers and performers, and moreover took charge of Benista&rsquo;s
      money, and she thinks he had considerable savings. Poor woman, I believe
      she had no idea of the harm she might be doing me, though it was scarcely
      in human nature to see prosperity look so aggressive without trying to
      profit thereby; and when she had put herself into O&rsquo;Leary&rsquo;s power, the
      notion was to make an income out of me by private threats and holding
      their tongues. That I should have any objection to such an arrangement,
      except on economical principles, never entered their heads, and they tried
      to make as much as possible out of either me or Clement, by withholding
      all the information possible till it was paid for, and our simultaneous
      refusal to be blackmailed entirely disconcerted them, and made them
      furious. Lida said the man was violent with her mother for letting out
      even what she did to trousseau, and the first annoyance was with Clement
      for not allotting a disproportioned sum for the purpose. He declared that
      Francie ought not to have more spent on her than was reserved for her

      refusal to be blackmailed entirely disconcerted them, and made them
      furious. Lida said the man was violent with her mother for letting out
      even what she did to Lance, and he meant to put a heavy price even on the
      final disclosure, in the trust (which I share) that it may prove the key
      to the mystery. She had no notion that the doubt was upsetting my
      position. Poor thing, she never had a chance in her life&mdash;gipsy
      breeding at first, then Benista&rsquo;s tender mercies and the wandering life.
      She could not fail to love my father till his requirements piqued her, and
      it was a quarrel, exasperated perhaps by the commencement of his illness,
      over her neglect of my unlucky self, and her acceptance of Schnetterling&rsquo;s
      attentions, that led to her abandoning him. I really do not think she ever
      realized that it was a sin. That good Pere Duchamps is the first priest of
      any kind she ever listened to, and he has had a great effect upon her. He
      would like to extend it to Lida and me, but Lida is staunch to her
      well-beloved Mr. Flight as well as to me, and there is a church on the
      other side the bay to which I take her when our patient is well enough to
      spare her to walk, or we can afford the crossing. Easter was a comfort
      there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The warm weather has revived the patient, and she may live some months
      longer, though she is a mere skeleton. Lida tends her in the most
      affectionate manner, and is really a little angel in her way. She has got
      some private pupils in music, and is delighted to bring in grist to the
      mill, which grinds hard enough to make me realize the old days you are so
      fond of recollecting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me to send you the Lacustrian. I am ashamed of it, and of my
      own articles. Nothing will go down here but the most highly spiced, and it
      is matter of life and death to us, as long as my mother lives, to keep on
      the swaying top of the poplar tree of popularity. You would despise the
      need, and talk of Felix, but it is daily bread, and I cannot let my mother
      and sister starve for opinions of mine. One comfort for you is that if I
      ever do come home again to reign at Vale Leston, I shall have seen the
      outcome of various theories of last year, and proved what is the effect of
      having no class to raise a standard or to look up to. I don&rsquo;t think I
      shall be quite so bumptious, and I am quite sure I shall value my Cherie&rsquo;s
      tenderness much better than I have ever done, more shame for me! Love to
      the bride and all at Vale Leston. There is an old age of novelty about
      these eastern states, quite disgusting in comparison with the reverend
      dignity of such a place as Vale Leston. You never thought that I
      appreciated it! You will find no fault with me on that score now. The lake
      is beautiful enough, but I begin to hate the sight of it, especially when
      a Yankee insists on my telling him whether we have in all Europe anything
      better than a duck-pond in comparison. Little Lida is my drop of comfort,
      since she has ceased to be mortally afraid of &lsquo;Brother.&rsquo; Love to all and
      sundry again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your loving G.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a consultation over this letter, which ended in John Harewood&rsquo;s
      volunteering to go to Genoa, and find out this Menotti or his
      representative, returning in time for the wedding, and hoping that the
      uncertainty would thus be over in time for the enjoyment of a truly
      prosperous event.
    </p>
    <p>
      A letter that came before his departure rendered Geraldine doubly anxious
      for the decision. Mrs. Henderson sent it to her to read, saying that it
      was by Lady Merrifield&rsquo;s advice, since she thought that it should be known
      how it was with Gerald, for even to Dolores he had not told half what
      Ludmilla related.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MY DEAREST MRS. HENDERSON,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a long time since I received your dearest, kindest of letters, and
      if I did not answer it sooner, it was not from want of gratitude, but
      attendance on my poor dear mother and assistance to our landlady occupies
      me at every minute that I can spare from giving music lessons to some
      private families, and an evening class. I am very thankful to be able to
      earn something, so as to take off something of the burthen on my dear
      brother&rsquo;s shoulders. For, alas! the care and support of my mother and me
      weigh very heavily upon him. The proprietor of the Lacustrian has parted
      with his other clerk, and my brother has the entire business of not only
      writing, extracting for, and editing the paper, but of correcting the
      press, and he dares not remonstrate or demand better payment, as we live
      from week to week, and he could not afford to be dismissed. He is at the
      office all day, beginning at six in the morning to meet the central
      intelligence, he only rushes home for his meals, and goes back to work
      till twelve or one o&rsquo;clock at night. Even then he cannot sleep. I hear him
      tossing about with the pain in his back that sitting at his desk brings
      on, and his hands are so tired by writing, and with the heat, which has
      been dreadful for the last few weeks, and has taken away all the appetite
      he ever had. You would be shocked to see him, he is so thin and altered; I
      cannot think how he is to continue this, but he will not hear of my
      writing to Lady Travis Underwood. He is never angry, except when I try to
      persuade him, and you never saw anything like his patience and gentleness
      to my poor mother. She never did either, she cannot understand it at all.
      At first she thought he wanted to coax the confession out of her, and when
      she found that it made no difference, she could not recover from her
      wonder&mdash;he, whom she had deserted in his babyhood, and so cruelly
      injured in his manhood, to devote himself to toiling for her sake, and
      never to speak harshly to her for one moment. She knew I loved her, and
      she had always been good to me, except when O&rsquo;Leary forced her to be
      otherwise, but his behaviour has done more to touch her heart than
      anything, and I am sure she is, as Pere Duchamps says, a sincere penitent.
      She is revived by the summer heat, and can sit under the stoop and enjoy
      the sweet air of the lake; but she is very weak, and coughs dreadfully in
      the morning, just when it is cooler, and my brother might get some sleep.
      She tries to be good and patient with us both, and it really does soothe
      her when my brother can sit by her, and talk in his cheerful droll way;
      but he can stay but a very short time. He has to rush back to his horrid
      stuffy office, and then she frets after him and says, &lsquo;But what right have
      I to such a son?&rsquo; and she begins to cry and cough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Clement, as Geraldine, unable to speak for tears, gave him the
      letter. &ldquo;This is a furnace of real heroism.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Christian heroism, I am sure,&rdquo; said Geraldine. &ldquo;Oh, my boy, I am proud of
      him. He will be all the better for his brave experiment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he had an instinct that it would be wholesome, besides the impelling
      cause. Real hardship is sound training.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it is not too hard,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Let not their precious balms break my head,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Clement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not like that pain in the back. Remember how he dragged his limbs
      when first we had him at home, and how delicate he was up to thirteen&mdash;only
      eight years ago!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably it will not last long enough to do him much harm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how nobly uncomplaining he is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This has brought out all the good we always trusted was in reserve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better than Emilia&rsquo;s experiment,&rdquo; sighed Geraldine.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Emilia Vanderkist, before her year was over, was at home, having
      broken down, and having spent most of her holidays with Mrs. Peter Brown,
      the wife of Sir Ferdinand&rsquo;s partner. She had come back, not looking much
      the worse for her hospital experience, but with an immense deal to say of
      the tyranny of the matron, the rudeness of the nurses to probationers, the
      hardness and tedium of the work to which she had been put, and the
      hatefulness of patients and of doctors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anna sympathized with all the vehemence of her sisterly affection, and
      could hardly believe her aunts, who told her that things must have changed
      in a wonderful manner since the time of Angela&rsquo;s experiences, for she had
      been very happy in the same place, and made no complaints.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emilia had written to her cousin Marilda to express her willingness to
      return so soon as the Travis Underwoods should come home, and in the
      meantime she remained at Vale Leston, not showing quite as much tolerance
      as might be expected of the somewhat narrow way of life of her sisters.
      She did not like being a lodger, as it were, in Sophy&rsquo;s bedroom; she found
      fault with the parlour-maid&rsquo;s waiting, complained of the noise of the
      practising of the three little sisters, and altogether reminded Geraldine
      of Alda in penance at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Harewood was detained longer than he expected, for on arriving at
      Genoa he found that Menotti had migrated, and had to follow him to his
      villa on the Apennines, where, in the first place, he had to overcome the
      old man&rsquo;s suspicions that he was come to recover Benista&rsquo;s means on behalf
      of his family, and then at last was assured that the man had been dead
      long before 1870. Still John Harewood thought it well to obtain positive
      evidence, and pursued the quest to Innspruck, where Menotti averred that
      the man had been left by his companions dying in the care of some Sisters
      of Charity.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it proved. At Innspruck, the record of the burial of Giovanni Benista,
      a native of Piedmont, was at length produced, dated the 12th of February,
      1868, happily and incontestably before Zoraya&rsquo;s marriage to Edgar
      Underwood!
    </p>
    <p>
      John Harewood made haste to telegraph the tidings to Vale Leston and to
      Jonesville, and came home exultant, having dispelled the cloud that had
      brooded over the family for nearly a year, and given them freely to enjoy
      the wedding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Would they do so the more or the less for Emilia&rsquo;s announcement that she
      had a letter from Mr. Ferdinand Brown, eldest son of Sir Ferdinand&rsquo;s
      partner, offering her marriage, and that she had accepted him? He was, of
      course, a rich man, but oh! how Emily, Annie, and Gerald had been wont to
      make fun of him, and his parents.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear Nan,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I shall be able to do much more good in
      that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And really I cannot go back to those intolerable backgammon evenings at
      Kensington Palace Gardens.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXXIII. &mdash; A MISSIONARY WEDDING
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Till the smooth temper of my age might be
     Like the high leaves upon the holly tree.&mdash;SOUTHEY.
</pre>
    <p>
      The neighbourhood said that nothing was ever done at Vale Leston according
      to the conventionalities, and the Devereux wedding was an instance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lancelot had brought word that Bishop Norman May had actually arrived from
      New Zealand for a half-year&rsquo;s visit, bringing with him the younger
      missionary Leonard Ward, and that Dr. May&rsquo;s happiness was unspeakable. &ldquo;A
      renewed youth, if he needed to have it renewed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clement and William Harewood went over to see them, and returned greatly
      impressed, and resolved on convoking the neighbourhood to be stirred in
      the cause of the Pacific islands. At the same time, one of the many
      letters from Lady Rotherwood about arrangements ended with&mdash;&ldquo;My
      husband hopes you will be able to arrange for us to be introduced to your
      connections of the May family, the Bishop, Mr. Ward, and the good old
      doctor of whom we have heard so much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must invite them all to the wedding,&rdquo; said Mrs. Harewood, who, as
      still inhabiting the Priory, would be the hostess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; returned William Harewood, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t think Mr. Ward would
      come. He looks like an ancient hermit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The best way,&rdquo; said Mrs. Grinstead, &ldquo;would be to finish up the
      wedding-day with a missionary garden-party.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Geraldine!&rdquo; said Lady Vanderkist from her sofa, in feeble accents of
      dismay; but Mrs. William Harewood hardly heard, and did not notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be the most admirable plan. It would give people something to
      do, and make a reason for having ever so many more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Baits cleverly disposed,&rdquo; said William. &ldquo;The S.P.G. to attract Ward, Ward
      to attract the Marquis, and the Marquis to attract the herd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everybody throngs to the extremest outskirts of a wedding,&rdquo; said
      Geraldine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They may have the presents on view in the long room,&rdquo; said Wilmet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Provided they don&rsquo;t have the list of them printed,&rdquo; said Geraldine.
      &ldquo;Lance won&rsquo;t put them into the &lsquo;Pursuivant&rsquo;; it is disgusting!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I have always thought,&rdquo; said Robina; &ldquo;but you hardly make allowances
      for the old ladies who love to spell them out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Marquis of Rotherwood&mdash;a gold-topped dressing-case; Miss Keren
      Happuch Tripp&mdash;a pincushion,&rdquo; said Geraldine. &ldquo;It is the idlest
      gossip, and should not be encouraged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And,&rdquo; added Robina, &ldquo;as we go out through the cloister there will happily
      be no rice. Will has stopped it in the churchyard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And fortunately we have no school-boys to reckon with, except Adrian and
      Fely, who will be quite amenable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For Kester Harewood was in India, and Edward on the Mediterranean; Adrian
      was at home, doing credit to Miss Mohun, and so vehemently collecting
      stamps, that he was said to wish to banish all his friends to the most
      remote corners of the earth to send them home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Francie&rsquo;s elder sisters declined being bridesmaids, so that Phyllis and
      Mysie were the chief, and the three young sisters, Wilmet, Alda, and Joan,
      with two little Underwoods and two small Harewoods, all in white frocks
      and sashes, were to attend and make a half-circle round the bride.
    </p>
    <p>
      All took effect as had been purposed, each party being equally desirous
      that it should be truly a Christian wedding, such as might be a fit emblem
      of the great Marriage Feast, and bring a blessing&mdash;joyous and happy,
      yet avoiding the empty pomp and foolish mirth that might destroy the
      higher thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      How beautiful Vale Leston church looked, decked with white roses, lilies,
      and myrtle! The bride, tall and stately in her flowing veil and glistening
      satin train, had her own sweet individuality, not too closely recalling
      the former little bride. She came on her uncle Clement&rsquo;s arm, as most
      nearly representing a father to her, and the marriage blessing was given
      by the majestic-looking Bishop, with the two chief local clergy, Mr.
      William Harewood and Mr. Charles Audley, taking part of the service. It
      was a beautiful and impressive scene, and there was a great peace on all.
      It was good to see the intense bliss on Ivinghoe&rsquo;s face as he led his
      bride down the aisle, and along the cloister; and as they came into the
      drawing-room, after she had received an earnest kiss, and &ldquo;my pretty one&rdquo;
       from his father, it was to Dr. May that he first led her. Dr. May, his
      figure still erect, his face bright and cheery, his brow entirely bare,
      and his soft white locks flowing over his collar. He held out his hands,
      &ldquo;Ah, young things! You are come for the old man&rsquo;s blessing! Truly you have
      it, my lady fair. You are fair indeed, as fair within as without. You have
      a great deal in the power of those little hands, and you&mdash;oh yes,
      both of you, believe, that a true, faithful, loving, elevating wife is the
      blessing of all one&rsquo;s days, whether it be only for a few years, or, as I
      trust and pray it may be with you, for a long&mdash;long, good, and
      prosperous life together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two young things bent their heads, and he blessed them with his
      blessing of eighty years. Lord Rotherwood&rsquo;s eyes were full of tears, as he
      said in a choked voice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; while Franceska murmured to Mysie&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do like that he should have been the first to call me &lsquo;my lady.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The luncheon included only the two families, and the actual assistants at
      the wedding, and it was really very merry. Lady Rotherwood did inspire a
      little awe, but then Alda, sitting near, knew exactly how to talk to her,
      and Alda, who, like Geraldine, had dressed herself in soft greys and
      whites, with her delicate cheeks flushed with pleasure and triumph, looked
      as beautiful as ever, and far outshone her twin, whose complexion and
      figure both had become those of the portly housewife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meta, otherwise Mrs. Norman May, had eyes as bright and lively as ever,
      though face and form had both grown smaller, and she was more like a fairy
      godmother than the Titania she had been in times of old. She had got into
      the middle of all the varieties of children, dragged thither by Gertrude&rsquo;s
      Pearl and Audrey, and was making them happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel and Geraldine never could come to the end of what they had to say to
      one another, except that Ethel could but be delighted to make her friend
      know the brother of her early youth; and show her the grave,
      earnest-looking man who had suffered so much, and whose hair was as white
      as the doctor&rsquo;s, his face showing the sunburn of the tropics; and the
      crow&rsquo;s-feet round his eyes, the sailor&rsquo;s habit of searching gaze. He did
      not speak much, but watched the merry young groups as if they were a sort
      of comedy in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were very merry, especially when the doctor had proposed the health
      of the bride, and her brother, Sir Adrian, was called on to return thanks
      for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen and ladies,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;no, I mean ladies and gentlemen, I am
      very much obliged to you all for the honour you have done my sister. I can
      tell Lord Ivinghoe she is a very good girl, and very nice, and all that,
      when she is not cocky, and doesn&rsquo;t try to keep one in order.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The speech was drowned in laughter, and calls to Ivinghoe to mind what he
      was about, and beware of the &ldquo;new woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So the young couple were seen off to spend their honeymoon in Scotland,
      and the rest of the party could pair off to enjoy their respective
      friends, except that Mary and Sophy had to exhibit the wedding presents to
      all and sundry of the visitors of all degrees who began to flock in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seats were ranged on the lawn, and when every one had had time to wonder
      at everything, from Lady Rotherwood&rsquo;s set of emeralds, down to the
      choirboys&rsquo; carved bracket, the house-bell was rung, and all had to take
      their places on the lawn, fairly shaded by house, cloister, and cedar
      tree, and facing the conservatory, whose steps, with the terrace, formed a
      kind of platform. It is not needful to go through all, or how John
      Harewood, as host, explained that they had thought that it would be well
      to allow their guests to have the advantage of hearing their distinguished
      visitors tell of their experiences. And so they did, the Bishop pleading
      the cause of missions with his wonderful native eloquence, as he stood by
      the chair where his father sat listening to him, as to a strain of sweet
      music long out of reach. Then Leonard Ward simply and bluntly told facts
      about the Pacific islands and islanders, that set hearts throbbing, and
      impelled more than one young heart to long to tread in the like course.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Lord Rotherwood thanked and bungled as usual, so that Gustave
      Tanneguy would have a hard matter to reduce what he called the
      &ldquo;aristocratic tongue&rdquo; to plain English, or rather reporter&rsquo;s English. The
      listeners were refreshed with tea, coffee, and lemonade, and there was a
      final service in the church, which many gladly attended, and thus ended
      what had been a true holiday.

      &ldquo;MY DEAR MADAM,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were so kind as to tell me to write to your ladyship if we were in
      any difficulty or distress, and I have often longed to do so, but my
      brother always said that we had no right to trespass on your goodness.
      Now, however, things are at such a pass that I think you will hear of us
      with true compassion. I do not know whether he told you that we met my
      poor mother on board a steamer upon this lake. Her husband had been
      drowned in a wreck while crossing, and she was reduced to great poverty,
      and had also, from exposure, contracted disease of the lungs, which, the
      doctor said, must terminate fatally in a few months. My brother took
      charge of her, and has supported us ever since, now four months, by
      working at the editorship of the Lacustrian Intelligencer, with such small
      assistance as I could give by music lessons. It involved severe labour at
      desk work and late hours, and his health has latterly given way, his back
      and lower limbs being gradually affected, and last Monday even his hands
      proved helpless. My poor mother broke another blood-vessel on Sunday, and
      died ten minutes later. My brother desired me to sell his dear violin and
      his watch to pay the funeral expenses, but after that I know not what we
      can do, as he is quite helpless, and can hardly be left even for the sake
      of my small earnings. Dear Lady Travis Underwood, pray help us, as I know
      you and Sir Ferdinand love my poor dear generous brother, and will not
      think him ungrateful for having declined your kindness while he could
      support himself and us. No doubt we shall get help from England, but not
      for some time, so I dare to ask you.

     </p>
    <p>
      This sad letter, in Lida&rsquo;s neat pupil-teacher&rsquo;s hand, came enclosed within
      a longer letter from Marilda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grand National Hotel, Jonesville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;July 23rd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MY DEAR GERALDINE,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will believe that this letter from poor Lydia made Fernan telegraph
      at once to her, and hurry off as soon as we could reach the train. We
      found things quite as bad or worse than we expected. The poor children
      were living in two rooms in a wretched little house of an Irish collier,
      who with his wife happily has been very kind to them, and says that
      nothing could surpass their goodness to that poor mother of theirs, who,
      she tells me, &lsquo;made a real Christian end&rsquo; at last. I am sure she had need
      to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The burial was happily over, conducted by the French priest, as the woman
      was a Roman Catholic to the last. Gerald was sitting up by the window, so
      changed that we should not have known him, except for the wonderful
      likeness to Felix that has come upon him. It seems that he had not only
      all the writing of that horrid paper to do, but all the compositor&rsquo;s work,
      or whatever you call it. The people put upon him when they saw how well he
      could do it, and he could not refuse because his mother needed comforts,
      and he durst not get thrown out of employment. He went on, first with
      aching back, then his legs got stiff and staggering, but still he went on,
      and now it has gone into his hands; he cannot hold a pen, and can hardly
      lift a tea-cup. But he is so cheerful, almost merry. The doctor says it is
      a paralytic affection, and that overwork has developed the former disease
      from the old injury to the spine, which seemed to have passed off, and
      there is intermittent fever about him too, a not uncommon thing in these
      low-lying lake districts. We have moved him to this Grand National Hotel,
      a big, half-inhabited place, but better than the MacMahons&rsquo; house, though
      the good woman cried over him and Lydia at their farewells, and said she
      never should see such a young gentleman and lady again with hearts so like
      ould Ireland. She would hardly take the money that Fernan offered her; she
      said they had brought a blessing on her house with their tender, loving
      ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fernan is gone to Milwaukee to get further advice and more comforts for
      Gerald, and we mean, as soon as he can be moved, to take him home with us,
      since the air of the Rockies will revive him if anything will. This place
      is fearfully hot and oppressive; the bay seems to shut out air from Lake
      Erie, and I cannot bear to think what that poor boy must have gone through
      in that close little den, with the printing-press humming and stamping
      away close to him; but he says it is his native element, and that when he
      is better he must go to Fiddler&rsquo;s Ranch. He sends his love, and fears that
      you have missed his letters, but he could hardly write them, and thought
      Lydia might alarm you. He is a very dear boy, and I do hope we make him
      comfortable; he is so thankful for the little we can do for him, and so
      patient. He tells me to give special love to Francie, and say he is glad
      that Mona&rsquo;s game of chess was played out with a good substitute for
      Ferdinand. These are his words, which no doubt she will understand. We
      think of moving next week, but much depends on the doctor&rsquo;s verdict. My
      love too to the dear Francie; she will be a great lady, quite beyond our
      sphere. Perhaps she may be able to give Emily some amusements, though I
      fear they will only make her more discontented with our humdrum ways. I
      never thought hospital work would suit her. Gerald says there is nothing
      like trying one&rsquo;s theories, and that having to exaggerate his own has made
      him sick of a good deal of them, though not of all. Poor dear boy, I hope
      he will live to show the benefits he says he has derived from this sad
      time. It shall not be for want of anything we can do. He is as near our
      hearts as ever his dear father was, and Lydia is a dear little girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your ever affectionate cousin,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MARY ALDA TRAVIS UNDERWOOD.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a great shock, though mitigated by hearing that Gerald was in such
      hands as those of his first friend, and kind Marilda; but there was great
      surprise at no notice being taken of the tidings that secured Gerald&rsquo;s
      position. John Harewood had telegraphed them, but it only now fully broke
      on him that he ought to have sent them to Jerry Wood instead of Gerald
      Underwood, so that Italian telegrams were not to blame.
    </p>
    <p>
      On one thing Clement ventured, being nearly certain that the reaction of
      Gerald&rsquo;s mind would not include the preventing of all Penbeacon works. He
      encouraged young Bramshaw to set about the plans so as to make the
      washings as innocuous as possible, being persuaded that this was the only
      way to prevent more obnoxious erections on ground just beyond. Moreover,
      this gave the lovers hope, and Alda had, under Clement&rsquo;s persuasion and
      rebukes, withdrawn her opposition to the engagement, so that Sophy was
      free to wander about Penbeacon with her Philip, and help to set up his
      theodolite, and hold the end of his measuring-tape.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mother could not well stand out on the score of unequal birth, when
      Mr. Ferdinand Brown, whose father had swept out the office, came down and
      was accepted with calm civility, it could not be called delight, even by
      Emilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he was a worthy young man, and well educated, and it was for his sake
      that Clement and Geraldine had stayed on at the Priory, giving the
      Harewoods and their curates holidays in turn; though even this amount of
      work was enough to leave with Clement a dread conviction that his full
      share of St. Matthew&rsquo;s would be fatal to him, insomuch that he had written
      to the patron, the Bishop of Albertstown, seriously to propose
      resignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fresh letters arrived from America, the first slightly more cheery, but
      the next was dated from Violinia, to the general surprise, and it was very
      short, from Sir Ferdinand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAR CLEMENT,

      &ldquo;We have the telegram, a relief to the poor lad&rsquo;s mind, but he has not
      spoken much since. It came just as we were starting in an invalid Pullman,
      fitted with every comfort; but the jars of these lines are unavoidable and
      unspeakable, and he suffered so terribly, as well as so patiently, that we
      had to give up our intention of taking him to Underwood. The one thing he
      begged for was that we would take him to Fiddler&rsquo;s Ranch. You know there
      is a mission-station here, so we have him in the clergyman&rsquo;s house, and
      the place is so advanced that he has every comfort. But I doubt whether
      the dear boy will ever move again. He is perfectly helpless, but his brain
      quite clear, and his spirits good.

      &ldquo;F. A. TRAVIS UNDERWOOD.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There followed a long letter, dictated by Gerald himself, and partly
      written by Lida, partly by Marilda, at several different times.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAREST, MOST DEAREST CHERIE, AND ALL&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to be able to sign my name to my thanks to all, if only to
      feel that I have a name, and one so honoured, but these fingers of mine
      will not obey me, so you must take the will for the deed, and believe that
      you have made me very happy, and completed all I could wish. I fear you
      never will believe how jolly it is to lie here, the pain all gone, since
      having done with that terrific train, and the three tenderest, most
      watchful of slaves always round me, while my Cherie is spared the sight of
      the wreck.&mdash;(L.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know that good old Fernan established a missionary station here,
      building a church, and getting the ground consecrated where my father
      lies. I can just see the top of the cross, and there he promises that I
      shall lie. You will be able to put my name in the cloister under my
      father&rsquo;s, as no impostor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t grieve, my Cherie, it is best as it is; my brains were full of more
      notions than you ever quite guessed, and of which I have seen the seamy
      side out here, though there is much that I should feel bound to work out,
      and that might have grieved you. I was not tough enough for the discipline
      that was needed to strike the balance. (He is thinking aloud, dear fellow.&mdash;M.
      A.) I am afraid I have often vexed you in my crudeness and conceit, but I
      know you forgive. I am very thankful for this year, and for the way in
      which my poor mother was given into my hands at last. Fernan has helped me
      to make a short will, to save confusion and difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have left everything to Clement, knowing that you and he will provide
      for all. Fernan and Marilda will care for Lida. (That we will.&mdash;M.
      A.) I cannot leave her to be a tax on Vale Leston. Give my books and MSS.
      to Dolores, and please be kind to her. My violin, which Fernan redeemed
      for me, the eponym (How do you spell it?&mdash;M. A.), by the way, of this
      place, my father&rsquo;s own fiddle, give to Lance for his pretty Ariel; Anna,
      my good sister, should have my music, which will be a memory of happy
      evenings. Emmie may like the portfolio of drawings that I made for the
      mission-house; dear old Sibby the photograph in my room of the &lsquo;Ecce
      Homo.&rsquo; I have it in my eye now.&mdash;(M. A.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything is such a comfort, Fernan and Marilda are the best of nurses
      and helpers, and I mourn for the folly that chaffed about them and
      boredom. Tell Emmie so. Fernan has made this place a little oasis round my
      father&rsquo;s grave, and his parson, who has a mission among the remains of the
      Sioux, is with me every other day, and does all that Clement could desire
      for me. So do&mdash;do believe that it is all for the best, dear people.&mdash;(L.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One thing good is, that I shall not bring any bad blood into the
      Underwood inheritance. By the bye, tell them&mdash;(Continued by Marilda)
      Mr. Gracchus Van &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; suddenly arrived here, greatly
      shocked at Gerald&rsquo;s state, and actually wanting to marry Lydia on the spot&mdash;which
      of course she declined. But Fernan was pleased with him, and he told him
      he had never met any one to hold a candle to &lsquo;Jerry Wood,&rsquo; so &lsquo;smart&rsquo; and
      &lsquo;chipper,&rsquo; as he saw at first, and then cheerful, good-humoured, and
      kindly, whatever happened. None of your Britisher&rsquo;s airs, but ready to
      make the best of any fixings. I don&rsquo;t think dear Gerald meant me to tell
      all this, but think of the difference from the fastidious fine gentleman
      he used to be! He is dozing now, I fear he is getting weaker; but he is
      ever so sweet and good, and I quite long to beg his pardon for having
      called him your spoilt boy. Mr. Fraser, the clergyman here, is very much
      struck with him, and Fernan remembers the time when he baptized him as he
      lay unconscious. Dear Cherry, it will grieve you, but I think there will
      be comfort in the grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your affectionate cousin,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. A. T. U.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There were long letters to Dolores, dictated to Lida&mdash;all in the same
      spirit. One of them said, &ldquo;Go bravely on, my Dolores; though we do not
      live together in our bicycle-roving castles. You will do good work if you
      uphold the glory of God and the improvement of man, all through creation
      and science. I should like to talk it over with you. Things are plainer to
      me than in the days of my inexperience and cocksureness. Short as the time
      was, in months, it showed me much more, especially my own inefficiency to
      deal with the great problems of these times, perhaps of all times.
      Remember this, but go on&mdash;if we do but put grains of sand into the
      great Edifice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      More was written, but these were the most memorable extracts, before the
      letter that told that something like a fresh stroke had come, and taken
      away the power of distinct speech, then that the throat had failed, and
      there was only one foreboding more to be told, and soon realized. The
      young ardent spirit, trained by so short a discipline, had passed away in
      peace. And they laid him beside his father, whose better spirit he had
      unconsciously evoked, and whom he had loved so deeply. The doctors said
      that the real cause of his death had been the Indian bullet, inflicting
      injury on the spine, which the elasticity of youth had for the time
      overcome, but which manifested itself again under overstrain. Ferdinand,
      when he awoke the child back to life, had given him years not spent in
      vain for himself or for others.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would have been utter desolation to the little sister save for the
      motherly tenderness of Marilda, who took her to the home in the Rocky
      Mountains, and would fain have adopted her, but that Lida, acting perhaps
      on advice from her brother, only begged to be so educated as to fit her to
      be independent, and to be given a start in life. It would be shown in a
      year or two whether her vocation should be musical or scholastic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gerald had his meed of tears at home, but not bitter ones. Nay, those that
      had the most quality of bitterness were Emilia&rsquo;s, shed in secret lest
      interpretations should be put on those that had the quality of remorse, as
      she recollected the high aspirations that had ended so differently in the
      two cousins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dolores dried hers, to feel a consecration on her studies and her labours
      as she grew forward to the fulfilment of her purpose of being a leading
      woman in the instruction and formation of young minds, working all the
      better for the inspiriting words and example, and the more gently and
      sympathizingly for the love that was laid up in her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      She and his &ldquo;Cherie&rdquo; came to have a great affection and understanding of
      each other, and discussed what Dolores called &ldquo;ethics&rdquo; with warm interest,
      the elder lady bringing the old and sacred lights to bear on the newer
      theories.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clement was the undoubted owner of Vale Leston, and the John Harewoods had
      decided on leaving the Priory. Just at the same time, when the acceptance
      of Clement&rsquo;s resignation of St. Matthew&rsquo;s had arrived, William Harewood
      was offered a canonry at Minsterham, with the headship of the theological
      college. The canonry had been the summit of his ambition when a boy, and
      there was no one fitter than he for the care of a theological college. He
      was pre-eminently a scholar, and his fifteen years of parish experience
      made good preparation for training young clergy.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Clement could decide on presenting himself to the living of Vale
      Leston, with a staff of curates, and Geraldine to be his home sister,
      making the Priory a resting-place for overworked people, whether clergy,
      governesses, or poor, or mission-folk at home. It was a trust to be kept
      for Lancelot and his boy, who would make the summer home of the family
      there, to Dr. May&rsquo;s great content. It was a peaceful home, and to every
      one&rsquo;s surprise, Alda decided to remain at hand, chiefly to keep her boy
      under his uncle&rsquo;s influence, which thus far was keeping him well in hand,
      and as he would go to a public school with little Felix, might be
      prolonged.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a comfort and encouragement to feel that hereditary dangers and
      temperament could be subdued and conquered in Gerald; and if the sins of
      parents had their consequence in the children, the scourge might become a
      palm. When the commemorative brass in the cloister was to be put up,
      Geraldine said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to put &lsquo;Rejoice with me, for I have found the piece that
      was lost.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He never was lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no, no, my dear boy. But his work was so like the finding the stained,
      tarnished piece of silver, cast aside, defaced, dust-marked, and by simple
      duty and affection bringing her back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see! Let us have the inscription in Greek. Then none can apply it to
      himself! It was a wonderful work, and it is strange that having fulfilled
      it, he who brought the child from his father&rsquo;s arms should lay him to his
      rest beside his father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo;, WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
